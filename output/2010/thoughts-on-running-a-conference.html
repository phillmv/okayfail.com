<ul data-sourcepos="5:1-37:0">
<li data-sourcepos="5:1-6:0">
<p data-sourcepos="5:3-5:145">Get a good night’s sleep the day before the conference. If you’re doing a good job you will barely sleep at all for the rest of the conference.</p>
</li>
<li data-sourcepos="7:1-8:0">
<p data-sourcepos="7:3-7:73">Naps in hotel lobbies are a great way to spend superfluous lunch hours.</p>
</li>
<li data-sourcepos="9:1-10:1">
<p data-sourcepos="9:3-9:114">It sucks to cut off a great speaker because you’re running out of time. Try to massage the time limit into them.</p>
</li>
<li data-sourcepos="11:1-12:1">
<p data-sourcepos="11:3-11:155">Get everything that needs to be printed finished at least a week before the conference start (unless you possess some deep love of frantic all nighters).</p>
</li>
<li data-sourcepos="13:1-14:0">
<p data-sourcepos="13:3-13:208">The time in between talks is not the best opportunity to expose people to your taste in indie electro pop anarcho vegan grindcore. Keep it simple. (<a href="http://twitter.com/KaitlinMS/statuses/8042317805">D’oh!</a>)</p>
</li>
<li data-sourcepos="15:1-16:1">
<p data-sourcepos="15:3-15:123">Competent and responsible people are worth their weight in gold. Knowing someone’s got your back is an <em>awesome</em> feeling.</p>
</li>
<li data-sourcepos="17:1-18:2">
<p data-sourcepos="17:3-17:343">What comes off as an asshole over email can easily turn out to be shy and extremely busy in person. Mind you, I still think, uh, what <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=If+you+want+to+know+what+a+man's+like,+take+a+good+look+at+how+he+treats+his+inferiors,+not+his+equals.&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=">Sirius Black</a> once said still applies.</p>
</li>
<li data-sourcepos="19:1-20:0">
<p data-sourcepos="19:3-19:182">People have an absolutely astonishing capacity to not respond to emails. This was the most stunning thing I learned while organizing the conference. That was probably naïve of me.</p>
</li>
<li data-sourcepos="21:1-22:1">
<p data-sourcepos="21:3-21:160">Emails are informationally porous. No one actually bothers to <em>read</em> them. If there is anything they need to remember, say it within two or three paragraphs.</p>
</li>
<li data-sourcepos="23:2-24:1">
<p data-sourcepos="23:4-23:198">Distribute lots of power bars throughout the conference. I learned this at <a href="http://futureruby.com">FutureRuby</a> and <a href="http://rubyfringe.com">RubyFringe</a> but completely forgot come D-Day.</p>
</li>
<li data-sourcepos="25:1-26:0">
<p data-sourcepos="25:3-25:85">Hotel internet just sucks. It’s almost worth selecting a venue on this basis alone.</p>
</li>
<li data-sourcepos="27:1-28:0">
<p data-sourcepos="27:3-27:253">Nerds need to be coached into any social event. You have to force them to interact in some way. I occasionally still suffer from nerd-social-paralysis, but it’s easy to forget when you’ve been wired for a week, constantly talking to dozens of people.</p>
</li>
<li data-sourcepos="29:1-30:1">
<p data-sourcepos="29:3-29:61">On a related note, students find $7 drinks morally obscene.</p>
</li>
<li data-sourcepos="31:1-32:1">
<p data-sourcepos="31:3-31:91">If you’re giving away stuff in a raffle, write the damn randomizing script ahead of time.</p>
</li>
<li data-sourcepos="33:1-34:2">
<p data-sourcepos="33:3-33:195">Always get your speaker’s contact details and travel information beforehand. Due to the efforts of my excellent coworkers, the only time I had to worry was when a speaker checked in a day late.</p>
</li>
<li data-sourcepos="35:1-37:0">
<p data-sourcepos="35:3-35:287">The day after the conference can be brutal for some people. You go from being relatively important and receiving dozens of emails a day to a nobody the second the conference is over. After you physically recover, schedule some pleasant evenings with the friends you’ve been neglecting.</p>
