    <h5 class="date"><a href="financialization-fire-burns-cities.html">April 28, 2018</a> </h5>
    <p data-sourcepos="1:1-1:358">The best way to destroy a city, short of bombing, to let a real estate bubble eat through everything that makes it vibrant and unique. When land prices and rents rise much faster than incomes, the outcome is rather sad to observe: the city is quickly hollowed out. First its people leave and soon after so does its culture. We are now seeing this in Toronto.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="3:1-3:449">Our city is being homogenized, rendered bland not just in its geographic sorting of people by ethnicity and social class but also in its elimination of opportunity and innovation.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="financialization-fire-burns-cities.html#fn-tale-two-cities" id="fnref-tale-two-cities" data-footnote-ref>1</a></sup> We pride ourselves for our diversity but our city has become cruel and inhospitable to the indigent, the young, the newcomer. New ideas need old buildings, said Jane Jacobs, but what she meant specifically is that new ideas need <em>cheap rent</em>.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="financialization-fire-burns-cities.html#fn-jacobs" id="fnref-jacobs" data-footnote-ref>2</a></sup></p>
<p data-sourcepos="6:1-6:696">It is fair and correct to observe that when demand is high and supply is low, prices will soon increase. It does not take much effort to see the inadequacy of our housing stock; our rental buildings are crumbling,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="financialization-fire-burns-cities.html#fn-highrise-hell" id="fnref-highrise-hell" data-footnote-ref>3</a></sup> our condos are poorly laid out,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="financialization-fire-burns-cities.html#fn-poorly-laid-out" id="fnref-poorly-laid-out" data-footnote-ref>4</a></sup> our social housing is a disgrace<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="financialization-fire-burns-cities.html#fn-crumbling-social-housing" id="fnref-crumbling-social-housing" data-footnote-ref>5</a></sup> and yet many a private, freehold homeowner is a short distance from high quality jobs, transit, schools and other amenities. As I walk through our streets I yearn to tear every single family home down brick by brick and replace it with a three storey walkup — six apartments of five and a half rooms plus a balcony laid out in its stead.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="financialization-fire-burns-cities.html#fn-confession" id="fnref-confession" data-footnote-ref>6</a></sup></p>
<p data-sourcepos="8:1-8:63">Yet it is also fair to wonder about all this insatiable demand.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="10:1-10:268">Where does it come from? A new, sizable generation is coming of age and after all most of the city was not born here. Sure. But our supply is not that inadequate.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="financialization-fire-burns-cities.html#fn-market-urbanism" id="fnref-market-urbanism" data-footnote-ref>7</a></sup> Who are these people waging bidding wars, and who armed them with such terrible wealth?</p>
<p data-sourcepos="12:1-12:771">It has become impossible to ignore the flood of capital that is washing around us. A little under half of Toronto condo investors last year are renting their units for less than it costs to carry the investment.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="financialization-fire-burns-cities.html#fn-urbanation-cibc" id="fnref-urbanation-cibc" data-footnote-ref>8</a></sup> In 2016 and 2017, speculators made up <em>all of the growth</em> in the sales volume of low-rise houses.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="financialization-fire-burns-cities.html#fn-pasalis" id="fnref-pasalis" data-footnote-ref>9</a></sup> Residential buildings have been turned into ghost hotels, their long term tenants turfed for tourists on Airbnb.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="financialization-fire-burns-cities.html#fn-ghost-hotel" id="fnref-ghost-hotel" data-footnote-ref>10</a></sup> Large REITs are buying up affordably priced rental buildings in order to accelerate their gentrification.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="financialization-fire-burns-cities.html#fn-august-2017" id="fnref-august-2017" data-footnote-ref>11</a></sup> Immense volumes of global wealth are pouring into our cities;<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="financialization-fire-burns-cities.html#fn-global-wealth" id="fnref-global-wealth" data-footnote-ref>12</a></sup> the price of high-end detached houses in Vancouver now track capital outflows from China.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="financialization-fire-burns-cities.html#fn-vancouver-china" id="fnref-vancouver-china" data-footnote-ref>13</a></sup></p>
<p data-sourcepos="14:1-14:419">It is clear that our housing has become financialized. Financialization is when a service or commodity is turned into a tradable asset that then becomes desirable primarily for its ability to store and exchange value. When something becomes financialized, its production and commerce becomes dominated by its interaction with financial markets. Its original utility becomes secondary to its use as a flywheel for money.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="16:1-16:131">Bombs attack buildings, but financialization attacks people. Homes were meant to provide shelter, but now they’re something else.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="18:1-18:535">Rampant housing inflation seeps through the economy. It becomes a tax capital charges labour, as high rents eat away at every productive activity a city engages in. First, the poor are evicted, then the artists and the working class. Eventually, the petit bourgeois whose services defined the contours of the neighbourhood undergo a kind of deluxification. The local grocer blossoms into a hip restaurant. The butcher is replaced by another butcher, but one that deals exclusively in fair trade organic. Heaven help you find a daycare.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="20:1-20:571">Our markets are failing us. Uncontrolled land speculation doesn’t just harm the marginalized. It poisons the economy. Money follows the path of least resistence. Every week now we hear a new alarm being sounded over our looming debt crisis.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="financialization-fire-burns-cities.html#fn-wsj" id="fnref-wsj" data-footnote-ref>14</a></sup> We could have used this wave of cheap capital to fund productive investments, but instead we plowed it into renovations and McMansions. In order for our housing markets to function, our pricing mechanism must reflect the actual local demand for physical shelter and not the aggregate global demand for safe financial assets.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="22:1-22:484">It’s worth asking why. Why allow this to continue? The fiscal demand for housing may well always outstrip our ability to dig holes in the ground.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="financialization-fire-burns-cities.html#fn-speculation" id="fnref-speculation" data-footnote-ref>15</a></sup> What purpose does it serve to allow the cost of housing services to inflate beyong people’s ability to pay for it? Land is completely unlike any other commodity. There has never been a free market in land and there likely will never be one. When our market fail us, it is up to us to reshape them and make them useful again.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="24:1-24:244">Why does most of the benefit from upzoning accrue to land owners? Why shouldn’t we discourage the practice of land banking? Why shouldn’t we disincentivize fallow housing? Why do we allow wantom speculation models to destroy affordable housing?</p>
<p data-sourcepos="26:1-26:371">We can do lots of things. We can tax certain kinds of unproductive activity. We can keep better track of sales and financing information. We can prevent extractive business models via the judicious use of rent controls. We can tax wealth. We can legalize better kinds of density. Most importantly, we can build public housing that can sit outside of whims of the markets.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="28:1-28:62">We have lots of tools at our disposal. It’s time we used them.</p>
