    <p data-sourcepos="1:1-1:270">Due to an errant cron task that ran twice an hour from September 2010 to July 2011, I accidentally collected about 12,000 screenshots of the front page of the <a href="http://nytimes.com">nytimes.com</a> (unfortunately, you can only watch the whole 7 minutes if you stick to 480p).</p>

<p data-sourcepos="7:1-7:632">Working on this video was fascinating because the past year was filled with dramatic events (from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Copiap%C3%B3_mining_accident">Chilean miners</a> [<a href="http://youtu.be/sCKGOiauJCE?hd=1&amp;t=39s">0:39</a>] to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Spring">Arab Spring</a> [<a href="http://youtu.be/sCKGOiauJCE?hd=1&amp;t=3m38s">3:38</a>] and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_T%C5%8Dhoku_earthquake_and_tsunami">Japanse Tsunami</a> [<a href="http://youtu.be/sCKGOiauJCE?hd=1&amp;t=4m54s">4:54</a>]) that I got to watch unfold time and time again. Watch out for them in the video; I took special care to slow down certain time periods.</p>

<p data-sourcepos="11:1-11:248">Traditionally, the purpose of a newspaper’s front page was to entice the reader into delving further into the publication. As a consequence, they are roughly equivalent with whatever the editors thought were the most relevant news items of the day.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="13:1-13:56">That said, moments like this one are no longer possible:</p>
<p data-sourcepos="15:1-15:82"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dewey_Defeats_Truman"><img src="../img/truman.jpg" style="max-width:100%;"></a></p>
<p data-sourcepos="18:1-18:513">Having worked with and developed on a number of content management systems I can tell you that as a rule of thumb no one is storing their frontpage layout data. It’s all gone, and once newspapers shutter their physical distribution operations I get this feeling that we’re no longer going to have a comprehensive archive of how our news-sources of note looked on a daily basis. <a href="http://wayback.archive.org/web/20110815000000*/http://nytimes.com">Archive.org</a> comes close, but there are too many gaps to my liking.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="20:1-20:303">This, in my humble opinion, is a tragedy because in many ways our frontpages are summaries of our perspectives and our preconceptions. They store what we thought was <em>important</em>, in a way that is easy and quick to parse and extremely valuable for any future generations wishing to study our time period.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="22:1-22:120">Thanks for reading! If you have an idea of something fun to do with the data, <a href="http://twitter.com/phillmv">holla at me</a>.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="24:1-24:114">Interested in how this was put together? I wrote a <a href="http://okayfail.com/2011/howto-timelapse-nytimes.html">howto</a>.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="26:1-26:139">Thought this video was cool? <a href="http://okayfail.com/2011/bbc-timelapse.html">I made another one</a> using the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/">BBC</a>.</p>
