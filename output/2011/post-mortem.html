    <p data-sourcepos="1:1-1:57">2010 may be aptly described as the ‘year of the thesis’.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="3:1-3:234">It outlived an apartment, three semesters, two jobs, a relationship, a full conference planning and execution cycle, and spanned many countless weekend afternoons filled with dread and quiet procrastination over lattes and croissants.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="5:1-5:690">What began as a sly attempt to avoid boring and easy courses slowly came to dominate my life in subtle ways. I knew I was wasting too much time reading crap on the internet, and I was fascinated in a deeply geeky way with the idea of writing my own feed reader. I approached my advisor Hossein, who promptly gave me an incredible amount of leeway and freedom and off I went. When I began, though, I only had a fuzzy idea of what I wanted to accomplish and as a result I attacked the problem lazily and haphazardly. By April I possessed a proof of concept, a functional sketch of what I wanted to achieve, but I had no idea of how to convert that effort into something worth <em>writing about</em>.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="7:1-7:543">This soon began to consume me; the project was now overdue but I still had to perform a lot of basic research, which is a lot less fun than poking at a Rails project until something comes together. Research can be sickeningly open-ended and it is remarkably difficult to estimate correctly. You simply won’t know you’ve read enough until… you’ve read enough. With my graduation from university hanging in the balance and the enormity of my sunk costs yawning before me, it became ever more stressful and, perversely, easier to procrastinate.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="9:1-9:318">Just as I began to fail at this in earnest, I began to run out of money and had to get a job. That happened, and then I fell back into freelancing. It’s easy enough to put in a token effort when all you do all day is bum around, but performing more work after a full day of employment can become immensely frustrating.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="11:1-11:494">In the end, I think I did OK. I’m terribly disappointed at the huge amount of time I’ve wasted, and there are many things that could be improved. Now that I’ve had some time to mull over it, I already want to redo the video and I have all sorts of ideas on how to better execute the product — if only I weren’t exhausted of thinking about it. Despite this, it’s just about respectable and I would say it’s easily past two credits worth of effort. It’s just an undergraduate thesis, after all.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="13:1-13:496">What’s most interesting to me is the emotional toll it exacted. For unrelated reasons, around October I relapsed into yet another major depressive episode, an emotional state that afflicts me more often than I like to admit. I’m still struggling to recover from this period. In the process I lost a good friend and undoubtedly damaged my relationship with the dozen or so amazing people I see on a regular basis. For a lack of better words, it sucks. If we hang out on a regular basis, I’m sorry.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="15:1-15:528">When I finally finished describing the bulk of my work into the video you can see <a href="http://vimeo.com/17650044">here</a>, I was overwhelmed with an immense wave of relief. I was also struck with the parallels between suffering from project purgatory and a good depression. Both seem to remove any concept of a future; you can’t plan around it, and you begin to live on a day-to-day basis. I also haven’t really enjoyed any time off for about a year now. Any kind of leisure time that didn’t involve a social obligation was put aside.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="17:1-17:612">When you’re stuck, that kind of planning becomes inconceivable. I read very few books, went on zero trips, visited no museums, avoided shopping, I only played video games that worked on my phone, I took on no side projects. As a rule of thumb, any idle time was consumed by a vague guilt. Lacking any direction and motivation to actually work on the project, as a consequence I spent many an evening and weekend furiously reading bullshit on the internet while avoiding work. Which is… ironic considering my thesis topic. Basically, I always had answer to the question, “Don’t you have something better to do?”</p>
<p data-sourcepos="19:1-19:266">This new found sense of freedom is still astonishing to me. I was considering signing up for a recreational sports league the other day and I was struck with how inconceivable this was only a few weeks ago. That kind of time commitment! Just crazy fucking bullshit.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="21:1-21:244">For the first time in my life, I now find myself with absolutely zero long term commitments and it is both terrifying and fascinating. I’m done school, my short-term freelance gig has come to an end and I’m going to be forced to move in April.</p>

<a id="now-what" class="anchor" href="post-mortem.html#now-what" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Now what?</h2>
<p data-sourcepos="27:1-27:316">I’m at a bit of a crossroads in life. I want to become as good at my work as I know I am capable of being. I want to keep meeting interesting people and working on interesting things. I’m going to try to enjoy my upcoming (hopefully brief) period of unemployment, as I haven’t taken time off in about two years now.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="29:1-29:50">I don’t know, but hopefully I’m going to enjoy it.</p>
