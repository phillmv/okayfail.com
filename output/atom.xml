&lt;a id="everyone-transitions" class="anchor" href="#everyone-transitions" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Everyone Transitions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="3:1-3:132"&gt;People make a big deal out of transitioning &lt;a href="https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/health/transition/in-slow-motion/"&gt;your gender&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="5:1-5:230"&gt;Some people will call you brave, and others will threaten you with violence. Your friends and family might throw you a party, while your romantic partner might experience full on grief, and sit shiva for the person you used to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="7:1-7:68"&gt;It‚Äôs like a whole thing, but it doesn‚Äôt have to be. Here‚Äôs the deal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="9:1-9:118"&gt;Everyone transitions. Let‚Äôs say that again. &lt;strong&gt;Everyone&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;transitions&lt;/em&gt;. Everyone is transitioning, present continuous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="11:1-11:186"&gt;The only constant is change, and all of us are always changing all of the time. To live is to change, for only death is immutable ‚Äì and even then you spend a lot of time rotting first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="13:1-13:211"&gt;You are not the man your wife married all those years ago (that guy had more hair). Your closet is full of dresses you don‚Äôt feel like wearing anymore. You used to be really into nu metal, but‚Ä¶ now you‚Äôre not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="15:1-15:63"&gt;Yesterday, you were a baby and tomorrow you will be a babushka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="17:1-17:53"&gt;That‚Äôs life! You only live once, make the best of it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What is the point of the Liberal party?</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;h1 data-sourcepos="1:1-1:41"&gt;
&lt;a id="what-is-the-point-of-the-liberal-party" class="anchor" href="#what-is-the-point-of-the-liberal-party" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What is the point of the Liberal party?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="3:1-3:74"&gt;Here is my problem: why does Justin Trudeau even &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to govern anymore?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="5:1-5:227"&gt;As I write this, Trudeau is on the verge of stepping down, the dam has broken, his time is up, so fine ‚Äì but I was thinking about this question six months ago. You can repeat this question for Bonnie Crombie, here in Ontario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="7:1-7:294"&gt;(What does Bonnie Crombie want to do &lt;a href="https://www.thestar.com/politics/provincial/crombies-liberals-pledge-income-tax-breaks-that-they-say-doug-ford-has-failed-to-deliver/article_d014448a-a0f1-11ef-8c77-436b262bf60d.html"&gt;other than cut taxes&lt;/a&gt;? We already have a party that likes to cut taxes.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="9:1-9:69"&gt;What do Liberals want to accomplish? What do they want to govern for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="11:1-11:413"&gt;It‚Äôs not to do electoral reform. It‚Äôs not to expand social assistance. They had to be dragged kicking and screaming to expand pharmacare. It‚Äôs not to give rights to workers. It‚Äôs not to fix the housing crisis. They‚Äôre not radically expanding public transit. They‚Äôre not breaking up the oligarchies that rule our lives, or reducing inequality. They‚Äôve been reduced to limping along on climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="13:1-13:137"&gt;I am extremely thankful for legal weed, the canada child benefit, some modest daycare reform, and I think the carbon tax was a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="15:1-15:154"&gt;I obviously &lt;em&gt;prefer&lt;/em&gt; to have them in government than the ‚Äúdestroy everything that is nice and good and reward our cronies‚Äù alternative currently on offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="17:1-17:106"&gt;But why run? What‚Äôs the point? What‚Äôs the agenda? What else do you &lt;strong&gt;want to do&lt;/strong&gt; while in government?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="19:1-19:304"&gt;I could forgive the insufferable smarm these people exhibit at every opportunity if they were &lt;em&gt;competent&lt;/em&gt;, if they were good at their jobs, if there were mandarins in smoke filled rooms secretly pulling strings in a game of 4d chess. But it turns out, again and again, that given the ball they fumble it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="21:1-21:483"&gt;Look at &lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/canada-post-strike-recap-1.7409424"&gt;the Canada Post strike&lt;/a&gt;. Who won from that? If you were going to force workers back to work all along, why wait four weeks? Retailers got screwed, workers got screwed, the government looks bad, and the only winner here is the management at Canada Post, who refused to negotiate because they knew this would happen. &lt;em&gt;Those&lt;/em&gt; people will drift off to their next job being able to brag about cowing their union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="23:1-23:107"&gt;All of this just to protect a having subclass of part-time workers who are more exploited than full timers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="25:1-25:188"&gt;There‚Äôs no vision for the country. There‚Äôs just more of the same, keeping the lights on, protecting the status quo even as everyone agrees that it sucks, it‚Äôs untenable, it‚Äôs broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="27:1-27:115"&gt;Is it any wonder that people aren‚Äôt excited to go out and vote? YOU NEED TO MAKE PEOPLE EXCITED TO GO OUT AND VOTE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="29:1-29:108"&gt;What is the point of the Liberal party? I have some answers to this question but they‚Äôre all unflattering.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>UIs Should Be Versioned, Just Like We Version APIs</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;h1 data-sourcepos="1:1-1:52"&gt;
&lt;a id="uis-should-be-versioned-just-like-we-version-apis" class="anchor" href="#uis-should-be-versioned-just-like-we-version-apis" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;UIs Should Be Versioned, Just Like We Version APIs&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="3:1-3:389"&gt;Every organization that offers an application programming interface almost immediately starts to version it. APIs are essentially contracts between us, service providers, and our users. The bargain is you build your app using our service in some presumably mutually beneficial arrangement, and in exchange we promise to give you a stable platform atop which you will construct your dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="5:1-5:522"&gt;Everyone agrees that it is extremely rude to break an API. Changing APIs unexpectedly makes our users sad because their robots will break, and they will be forced to waste time and energy figuring out whatever broke. To prevent this, we version our APIs. Versions are clauses in this contract: we say, this is &lt;code&gt;v1&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;v2&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;20241231&lt;/code&gt; or whatever, and we hereby promise to not change it. Should you want to use latest and greatest features, you are free to upgrade at your leisure. Or not don‚Äôt upgrade, that‚Äôs fine too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="7:1-7:41"&gt;Why don‚Äôt we do this for user interfaces?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="9:1-9:230"&gt;We &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; version UIs, but we don‚Äôt.  We change UIs constantly, remorselessly. Every reason for providing stable interfaces applies just as well for &lt;em&gt;human beings&lt;/em&gt; as they do for robots ‚Äì but somehow we only respect the robots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="11:1-11:137"&gt;Why is that? Pure vibes but I feel like the reason ultimately is that we, the computer industry, hate people and wish for them to suffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="13:1-13:135"&gt;üëâ There‚Äôs absolutely &lt;strong&gt;no reason&lt;/strong&gt; why we can‚Äôt show the same care and attention to how changes impact our UIs as we do to our APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="15:1-15:348"&gt;We have zero respect for the effort humans have to put into learning interfaces, and we actively destroy any skills they may have painfully acquired for using the tools we gave them. You can spend a lifetime learning how to use a paint brush, a knife or a needle more skillfully, and be rewarded for it with efficiency and expertise.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-not-original" id="fnref-not-original" data-footnote-ref&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="17:1-17:214"&gt;Yet once a computer is involved a programmer somewhere will unthinkingly destroy all of that built up skill every 24-36 months just because &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_design"&gt;it‚Äôs no longer fashionable&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="19:1-19:172"&gt;Anyways, I was reminded of this while &lt;a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/never-forgive-them/"&gt;reading this depressing and correct essay by Ed Zitron about our dystopian present&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-sourcepos="21:1-21:488"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="21:2-21:488"&gt;The tools we use in our daily lives outside of our devices have mostly stayed the same. While buttons on our cars might have moved around [‚Ä¶] we generally have a brake, an accelerator, a wheel, and a turn signal. Boarding an airplane has worked mostly the same way since I started flying, other than moving from physical tickets to digital ones. We‚Äôre not expected to work out ‚Äúthe new way to use a toilet‚Äù every few months because somebody decided we were finishing too quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-sourcepos="23:1-23:333"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="23:2-23:333"&gt;Yet our apps and the platforms we use every day operate by a totally different moral and intellectual compass. While the idea of an update is fairly noble‚Ä¶ many tech platforms see it as a means to further extract and exploit, to push users into doing things that either keep them on the app longer or take more-profitable actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-sourcepos="25:1-25:594"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="25:2-25:594"&gt;We as a society need to reckon with how this twists us up, makes us more paranoid, more judgmental, more aggressive, more reactionary, because when everything is subtly annoying, we all simmer and suffer in manifold ways. There is no digital world and physical world ‚Äî they are, and have been, the same for quite some time, and reporting on tech as if this isn‚Äôt the case fails the user. It may seem a little dramatic, but take a second and really think about how many little digital irritations you deal with in a day. It‚Äôs time to wake up to the fact that our digital lives are rotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-sourcepos="27:1-27:218"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="27:2-27:218"&gt;I‚Äôm not talking about one single product or company, but most digital experiences. The interference is everywhere, and we‚Äôve all learned to accept conditions that are, when written out plainly, are kind of insane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-sourcepos="29:1-29:4"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="29:2-29:4"&gt;‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-sourcepos="31:1-31:374"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="31:3-31:374"&gt;Earlier in the year, smart speaker company Sonos released a redesign of its app that removed accessibility features and the ability to edit song queues or play music from your phone in an attempt to ‚Äúmodernize‚Äù the interface, with WIRED suggesting that the changes could potentially open the door to adding a subscription of some sort to help Sonos‚Äô ailing growth‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-sourcepos="33:1-33:579"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="33:2-33:579"&gt;Now, what‚Äôs important to accept here is that absolutely none of this is done with any real consideration of the wider effects on the customer, as long as the customer continues doing the things that the company needs them to. We, as people, have been trained to accept a kind of digital transience ‚Äî an inherent knowledge that things will change at random, that the changes may suck, and that we will just have to accept them because that‚Äôs how the computer works, and these companies work hard to suppress competition as a means of making sure they can do what they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="35:1-35:61"&gt;the end that‚Äôs the tweet full stop &lt;a href="/tags/antihumanism"&gt;#antihumanism&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="/tags/programming"&gt;#programming&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes" data-footnotes&gt;

&lt;li id="fn-not-original"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="37:18-37:141"&gt;This is not an original idea; I read something like this on someone‚Äôs blog, or on Mastodon, but darned if I can find it now. &lt;a href="#fnref-not-original" class="footnote-backref" data-footnote-backref aria-label="Back to content"&gt;‚Ü©&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>they‚Äôre going to build camps</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;h1 data-sourcepos="1:1-1:32"&gt;
&lt;a id="theyre-going-to-build-camps" class="anchor" href="#theyre-going-to-build-camps" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;they‚Äôre going to build camps&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="3:1-3:308"&gt;the day after The 2024 Election, i happened to be in berlin. the night before i‚Äôd assiduously avoided the news and yet somehow i didn‚Äôt fall asleep until late into the morning. it was as if i was channeling the world‚Äôs cumulative anxiety. i came to, feeling exhausted, and checked the news, and felt worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="5:1-5:373"&gt;it was an appropriately somber day: cold, foggy, near freezing. after we gathered our wits, we planned on visiting the brandenburg gate and the nearby memorials. on arrival, we saw a half dozen geriatric protestors holding a banner against russian war sanctions, and for ‚Äúpeace‚Äù, and a lone counter protestor with a ukrainian flag churned an organ grinder.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-euro-discourse" id="fnref-euro-discourse" data-footnote-ref&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="7:1-7:341"&gt;we wandered towards the holocaust memorials. it felt sobering, which of course is their purpose, though it‚Äôs not like i learned anything i didn‚Äôt know before. i had a ww2 phase&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-ww2-phase" id="fnref-ww2-phase" data-footnote-ref&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; in university, i‚Äôd visited these same monuments long ago. but this time on this day i was struck by the timelines presented in the memorial plaques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="9:1-9:432"&gt;it‚Äôs not like people got shipped to a camp from one day to the next, as soon as the reichstag burned down. there was a whole decade of ratcheting humiliation and persecution. prevented from leaving, forced to divest of your heritage and your life savings, separated from your family, and finally worked to death. at an industrial scale they squeezed every ounce of vitality and hope from you before extinguishing your flame forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="11:1-11:332"&gt;the last time i was here i didn‚Äôt have a family. the last time i was here i wasn‚Äôt queer yet, or at least i didn‚Äôt know it at the time. now i had an extra weight on my mind: is there anything worse than being separated from your children? people just like me were sent to these camps, too, a pink triangle pinned to their chest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="13:1-13:565"&gt;and i thought: they‚Äôre going to build new camps. first, they‚Äôll come for the undocumented immigrants; people who are not quite like me, but whose spanish last names are similar to mine. then, they‚Äôll come for the most annoying, the rowdiest leftists, the people willing to punch back and put their bodies on the line; people who have less to lose than i do, but whose politics are very similar to mine. and then, then they‚Äôll come for people exactly like me, folks who live and love in freedom. and after that, the deluge, the free-for-all, the grab what you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="15:1-15:268"&gt;at the next memorial, i wandered along the concrete stelae, feeling their smooth surface. as i walked along the uneven ground they rose above me, towering, grey columns against a grey sky. they obviously resemble giant tombstones: who could you have been?, i wondered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="17:1-17:219"&gt;and i thought: you can be ground to dust, and the echoes of your ghost will be used by your grandchildren to justify new atrocities. the death of your babies will be used to explain why someone else‚Äôs babies must die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="19:1-19:327"&gt;silence equals death, but as i type this i feel weary of talking too much or too plainly about &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; genocide, the genocide that‚Äôs currently happening, for fear of retribution. in some quarters talking about it critically has been nearly criminalized. i‚Äôve seen people get punished and blacklisted for speaking plain truths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="21:1-21:391"&gt;i‚Äôve seen people i respected spew vile, reprehensible things, whether openly racist or just knowingly obfuscated. it‚Äôs sobering to know who ‚Äì how many more ‚Äì will see my humanity as conditional, too. is this something i‚Äôd be willing to lose a job over? it‚Äôs not my people, it‚Äôs not my fight, it‚Äôs far away, there‚Äôs hardly anything we can do anyways, i don‚Äôt need the attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="23:1-23:23"&gt;am i on a list already?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes" data-footnotes&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-euro-discourse"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="25:20-25:235"&gt;i squinted and tried to replay my understanding of european political discourse. i think they‚Äôre pro the evil dictator mainly because they are anti-north atlantic alliance? the geezers had an ‚Äúanti-imperialist‚Äù vibe. &lt;a href="#fnref-euro-discourse" class="footnote-backref" data-footnote-backref aria-label="Back to content"&gt;‚Ü©&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-ww2-phase"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="26:15-26:455"&gt;i took a course on international relations leading up to ww1, which was mostly 19th century history. i took a course on ww2, and read the textbook, and then i read the rise and fall of the third reich (shirer), and then i read a world at arms (weinberg). i had a vague memory of newscasts playing footage from the fall of the berlin wall, but i did not apprehend its meaning until i took a course on the cold war. then i read postwar (judt). &lt;a href="#fnref-ww2-phase" class="footnote-backref" data-footnote-backref aria-label="Back to content"&gt;‚Ü©&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TCAF 2024 and "The Chromatic Fantasy"</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;h1 data-sourcepos="1:1-1:39"&gt;
&lt;a id="tcaf-2024-and-the-chromatic-fantasy" class="anchor" href="#tcaf-2024-and-the-chromatic-fantasy" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;TCAF 2024 and ‚ÄúThe Chromatic Fantasy‚Äù&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="3:1-3:213"&gt;Due to childcare commitments, I had a tight window. As soon as my youngest snoozed, I hopped on the subway and found myself at the Toronto Reference Library for the 2024 edition of the Toronto Comic Arts Festival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="5:1-5:80"&gt;I had exactly 45 minutes, which was obviously not enough time.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-not-enough-time" id="fnref-not-enough-time" data-footnote-ref&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="7:1-7:518"&gt;I made peace with this fact,&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-money-not-time" id="fnref-money-not-time" data-footnote-ref&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and set out to try score a few cool books. I floated around the first floor, where the main indie publishers set up shop, and felt out the vibes.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-super-fan" id="fnref-super-fan" data-footnote-ref&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Right away I came across &lt;em&gt;Shubeik Lubeik&lt;/em&gt; by Deena Mohamed, which &lt;a href="https://riteshbabu.net/2024/01/05/comics-i-loved-in-2023/"&gt;I‚Äôd seen on a best-of 2023 list&lt;/a&gt; and had been meaning to purchase. Sitting right next to it was Mattie Lubchansky‚Äôs &lt;em&gt;Boys Weekend&lt;/em&gt;, and those were both obvious and immediate gets.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-gender" id="fnref-gender" data-footnote-ref&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="9:1-9:324"&gt;I buzzed around the Drawn and Quarterly table (&lt;em&gt;Are You Willing To Die For The Cause?&lt;/em&gt;), and at Pow Pow‚Äôs table I picked up &lt;em&gt;Vampire Cousins&lt;/em&gt;, why not, and I felt like I &lt;em&gt;ought&lt;/em&gt; to read &lt;em&gt;Toxic: A Tour of the Ecuadorian Amazon&lt;/em&gt;, and so I picked that up too. (Who knew that the University of Toronto Press also prints comics?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="11:1-11:73"&gt;By now I was running out of time, but I felt like I wanted one more book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="13:1-13:206"&gt;I toured the tables out along the windows, but none of their wares spoke to me, and I found myself back along the main drag. I wandered towards the exit, nervously looking around, when a book caught my eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="15:1-15:146"&gt;The pages were gilded, and sparkled. I flipped through it, and the art seemed to want to leap out of every page. The description at the back read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-sourcepos="17:1-17:530"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="17:2-17:530"&gt;Jules is a trans man trapped in his life as a nun. The devil that the convent guards against offers him a deal to escape: an illicit tryst and lifelong possession. Jules takes the deal, and begins his new life as a criminal who‚Äôs impervious to harm. He soon meets Casper, another trans man and a poetic thief, and together they steal, lie, and cheat their way through bewildering adventures, and develop feelings for each other along the way. But as Jules and Casper‚Äôs relationship deepens, so does the devil‚Äôs jealous grasp‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="19:1-19:46"&gt;and I thought: COOL, GOOD ENOUGH, LET‚ÄôS DO IT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="21:1-21:148"&gt;I bought it and hurried home, arriving just before my two-and-a-half year old woke up, and we were due to go to grandma‚Äôs for mother‚Äôs day. Success!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="23:1-23:199"&gt;That book is &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://store.silversprocket.net/en-ca/products/the-chromatic-fantasy-by-h-a"&gt;The Chromatic Fantasy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and I want to tell you about it. It‚Äôs the reason why I am writing this blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-sourcepos="25:1-25:55"&gt;
&lt;a id="the-chromatic-fantasy-is-so-fucking-good-you-guys" class="anchor" href="#the-chromatic-fantasy-is-so-fucking-good-you-guys" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Chromatic Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; is so fucking good, you guys&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="27:1-27:53"&gt;I don‚Äôt know how to say this without overselling it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="29:1-29:332"&gt;I went into it with zero expectations, which imho is the best way to appreciate art, so from that perspective I have already ruined it. It‚Äôs also clear to me that a big part of its charm is precisely that it appeared serendipitously, right at the last moment, as if it was calling out to me, just like the devil in the story itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="31:1-31:92"&gt;You, dear reader, will not be able to enjoy it like I have enjoyed it, and I am sad for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="33:1-33:60"&gt;But what a story! Without any spoilers, the book deals with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul data-sourcepos="34:1-40:0"&gt;
&lt;li data-sourcepos="34:1-34:37"&gt;transitioning and navigating gender&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-sourcepos="35:1-35:32"&gt;abusive romantic relationships&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-sourcepos="36:1-36:32"&gt;abusive familial relationships&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-sourcepos="37:1-37:39"&gt;not fitting in, and suicidal ideation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-sourcepos="38:1-38:56"&gt;being an aimless scumbag in your early-to-mid-twenties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-sourcepos="39:1-40:0"&gt;and above all, falling in love and desperately wanting to live, and &lt;em&gt;be loved&lt;/em&gt; and to &lt;em&gt;be deserving of love&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="41:1-41:244"&gt;And it wraps all of this up in a one-shot, swashbuckling sword and sorcery adventure in a anachronistically medieval setting. The whole book is luscious, both sensual and luxuriating in detail, hardly any of which escape the author‚Äôs attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="43:1-43:190"&gt;Which makes sense, as I later found &lt;a href="https://www.comicsbeat.com/interview-h-a-on-the-chromatic-fantasys-technicolor-queer-realized/"&gt;this interview with the H.A., the author,&lt;/a&gt; where he says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-sourcepos="45:1-45:555"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="45:3-45:555"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;H.A.:&lt;/strong&gt; I was really stoked that it looked as good as I‚Äôd hoped it would. It was awesome to finally see it all come together. I really wanted the whole book, as an object, to feel like a complete maximalist work in itself. I didn‚Äôt want any page to feel underutilized. I‚Äôm really glad I was able to design the entire book cover and the title pages and everything. Silver Sprocket did a really good job with printing it and gave me a lot of freedom and I‚Äôm so glad they were able to help me make it as tacky and obnoxious as I wanted it to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="47:1-47:324"&gt;How fun is that? I think he did a great job. It‚Äôs fun, it‚Äôs sexy, the costumes and fashion and settings are gorgeous, and the characters are so well designed. It makes me think about being in my own mid-twenties, and getting high and spending too much time in a tumblr and wikipedia hole circa 2012, but like, in a good way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-sourcepos="49:1-49:25"&gt;
&lt;a id="a-note-on-being-queer" class="anchor" href="#a-note-on-being-queer" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;A note on being queer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="51:1-51:350"&gt;From the get-go, H.A. makes it clear that his mission is to make a goofy and campy romp featuring trans-men having fun. Just two dudes, having a good time, and being unabashedly queer. Yet here he does a funny thing: his characters don‚Äôt look like what I thought that they were going to look like, especially in a fantasy setting where anything goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="53:1-53:94"&gt;To quote &lt;a href="https://retrospring.net/@dirtcup_art/a/112069101918572008"&gt;from H.A.‚Äôs retrospring&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-sourcepos="55:1-55:176"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="55:3-55:176"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anonymous:&lt;/strong&gt; Ngl at first I thought Jules and Casper were lesbians and it was a surprise discovering they‚Äôre boys. Thank you for the way you convey their gender expression!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-sourcepos="57:1-57:177"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="57:3-57:177"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;H.A.&lt;/strong&gt;: my relationship w gender is complicated and I have a hard time naming it except to express it thru characters or by being myself and this is the best way I can do it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="60:1-60:229"&gt;Like, I myself, I identify as trans-femme. I think women are pretty great. I‚Äôve gone to great lengths to try to be more like women. Going in, I was ready to be like, this won‚Äôt neccessarily speak to me directly, and that‚Äôs fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="62:1-62:204"&gt;But now that I‚Äôve read the book, I‚Äôm like: if I &lt;em&gt;had to&lt;/em&gt; detransition? and be, like, a guy again (gross)? I would want my whole vibe to be like Casper‚Äôs in the comic. What a beautiful and chill way to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="64:1-64:60"&gt;Anyways, I‚Äôm going to buy three copies to give out as gifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes" data-footnotes&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-not-enough-time"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="66:21-66:318"&gt;To do TCAF properly, without rushing, you need at least three hours to properly wander the festival and take in all the sights and scenes. I really enjoy going to TCAF. I‚Äôve been, gosh, &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; a half dozen times. I remember going in 2005, when it was held in the parking lot behind Honest Ed‚Äôs. &lt;a href="#fnref-not-enough-time" class="footnote-backref" data-footnote-backref aria-label="Back to content"&gt;‚Ü©&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-money-not-time"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="67:21-67:214"&gt;In 2005, I had all the time in the world but I had to count my pennies and agonize over each and every purchase. As I approach middle age, I might lack time but I am at least blessed with money. &lt;a href="#fnref-money-not-time" class="footnote-backref" data-footnote-backref aria-label="Back to content"&gt;‚Ü©&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-super-fan"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="68:15-70:532"&gt;I‚Äôm not a comics‚Ä¶ super-fan. I love the medium; I think comics have a special power to capture the reader‚Äôs attention and take them away to another time and place. They provide a unique and arresting combination of visuals and text.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
But any given comic book has to speak to me, I don‚Äôt know. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The art has to ‚Äúpop‚Äù. Half-tone manga leaves me cold. I like that photocopied zines exist more than I enjoy actually reading them. If I were an artist myself, I might enjoy leafing through sketchbooks ‚Äì but I‚Äôm not, and so I don‚Äôt. In theory I feel like I should enjoy weird abstract experiments, but more often than not I just want to be charmed by a story and escape somewhere, or at least learn something new.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-comics-history" id="fnref-comics-history" data-footnote-ref&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Frankly, I have read one too many raw and overly honest autobiographical coming-of-age retellings. &lt;a href="#fnref-super-fan" class="footnote-backref" data-footnote-backref aria-label="Back to content"&gt;‚Ü©&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-gender"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="72:12-72:523"&gt;Here, a brief pause. A couple years ago, when I was figuring out my gender and coming out, Mattie was a rare source of inspiration for being trans-femme non-binary. I remember being fascinated with their transition. I‚Äôm happy to report that &lt;em&gt;Boys Weekend&lt;/em&gt; is a fun romp, and I felt simultaneously like the protagonist, a trans-femme non-binary former-beardo, and that I was being roasted. I‚Äôve always enjoyed TCAF, but gosh, now that I‚Äôm queer it‚Äôs taken on new depths. There were &lt;em&gt;so many of us&lt;/em&gt; milling around. &lt;a href="#fnref-gender" class="footnote-backref" data-footnote-backref aria-label="Back to content"&gt;‚Ü©&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-comics-history"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="71:21-71:415"&gt;I grew up on brazillian translations of Spiderman and X-Men comics, several issues cropped and bound into little A5 booklets they sold in papelarias. Occasionally we would get Duck Tales, or Mafalda. In highschool, I read &lt;em&gt;Sandman&lt;/em&gt; and was blown away. One of my best friends‚Äô cool older brother lent me his copy of Joe Sacco‚Äôs &lt;em&gt;Palestine&lt;/em&gt;, and every book Joe has made has felt like a revelation. &lt;a href="#fnref-comics-history" class="footnote-backref" data-footnote-backref aria-label="Back to content"&gt;‚Ü©&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

    <title>You're not Facebook. Why use their tools?</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;h1 data-sourcepos="1:1-1:43"&gt;
&lt;a id="youre-not-facebook-why-use-their-tools" class="anchor" href="#youre-not-facebook-why-use-their-tools" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;You‚Äôre not Facebook. Why use their tools?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="3:1-3:215"&gt;I‚Äôve seen folks expend remarkable amounts of effort to adopt Facebook tooling, for example GraphQL and React. Typically, the reasoning is that they‚Äôre Industry Best Practice‚Ñ¢ for Solving These Particular Problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="5:1-5:242"&gt;I don‚Äôt have well-formed or particularly nuanced views on the One True And Right Way To Make Rich Client Web Applications. But as I approach middle age I think I‚Äôve just enough experience to know when something is messier than it ought to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="7:1-7:200"&gt;I want to push back on this ‚ÄúIndustry Best Practice‚Äù view. I fear that the honest reasoning is more like ‚ÄúFacebook has high prestige; if I try to be more like Facebook, my own prestige will increase‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-sourcepos="9:1-9:31"&gt;
&lt;a id="facebook-is-an-anti-pattern" class="anchor" href="#facebook-is-an-anti-pattern" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Facebook is an anti-pattern&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="11:1-11:207"&gt;Instead of thinking ‚Äúwell, Facebook does this, and Facebook is a rich and successful company ‚Äì so it must be a good idea‚Äù, we should be more like ‚ÄúFacebook does this? ‚Äì ah, &lt;strong&gt;it‚Äôs probably a bad idea&lt;/strong&gt;‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="13:1-13:104"&gt;I have come to believe that ‚Äúwhatever Facebook does is an anti-pattern‚Äù is a much more useful heuristic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="15:1-15:52"&gt;My reasoning goes like this: &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; are not Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="17:1-17:283"&gt;Very few companies are shaped like Facebook, and therefore decisions that make sense for Facebook probably don‚Äôt make sense for you. It‚Äôs ironic, tragic even, that so many people think that tools that make sense for Facebook will automatically make sense for their own organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="19:1-19:79"&gt;There are two ways in the vast majority of organizations are not like Facebook:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol data-sourcepos="20:1-22:0"&gt;
&lt;li data-sourcepos="20:1-20:112"&gt;Facebook is a very high traffic, very high margin advertising business with a quasi monopoly on its audience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-sourcepos="21:1-22:0"&gt;Nothing important happens on Facebook.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 data-sourcepos="23:1-23:42"&gt;
&lt;a id="1-facebook-is-big-and-flush-with-cash" class="anchor" href="#1-facebook-is-big-and-flush-with-cash" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;1. Facebook is big, and flush with cash&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="25:1-25:378"&gt;Fact 1 means that &lt;strong&gt;Facebook has an unusual amount of resources at its disposal&lt;/strong&gt;. They can afford to pay developers obscene salaries to compensate for the moral injury of working at Facebook. And those developers can toil away at problems that are either irrelevant or out-of-scope for the vast majority of organizations that lack either their scale or their access to capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="27:1-27:389"&gt;Consider GraphQL. As a domain specific language for querying graph shaped data, it has an admirable goal. I‚Äôm sure it really is a remarkable tool for rich client developers to iterate on new designs without having to negotiate new APIs with their backend counterparts. As a single, common interface for querying data, data which is often stored in different silos, it sure seems promising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="29:1-29:367"&gt;But in practice‚Ä¶ well, those silos are real, they exist for (good and bad) reasons. If your data access spans several teams‚Äô areas of responsibility, then it‚Äôs fiendishly easy to end up with &lt;em&gt;stupendously slow &amp;amp; expensive queries&lt;/em&gt;. If ownership is diffuse, then no one‚Äôs worrying about the performance of this one retrieval pattern and you get weird scaling issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="31:1-31:75"&gt;If you‚Äôre joining data across mysql clusters, someone has to pay the piper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="33:1-33:384"&gt;Put another way: a GraphQL only makes sense if you have &lt;em&gt;a whole team dedicated&lt;/em&gt; to making it not suck. To have a GraphQL API at scale is to have a GraphQL API platform team whose sole job is to fuss over it and keep it ticking. The vast majority of organizations aren‚Äôt big enough, nor high margin enough, to justify spending millions of dollars a year optimizing their API platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="35:1-35:130"&gt;In most organizations, it probably really is easier to just ask the team responsible to open up an endpoint ‚Äì or do it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="37:1-37:233"&gt;(In this sense, GraphQL to me smells almost like an attempt to deal with Facebook‚Äôs org chart: the dedicated GraphQL platform team bears the coordination costs, instead of having dozens of teams duking it out with each other ad hoc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-sourcepos="40:1-40:30"&gt;
&lt;a id="2-facebok-is-not-important" class="anchor" href="#2-facebok-is-not-important" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;2. Facebok is not important&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="42:1-42:158"&gt;Which leads us into Fact 2: &lt;strong&gt;nobody cares if Facebook has downtime&lt;/strong&gt;. Nobody‚Äôs day is ruined because Facebook had ten or thirty or sixty minutes of downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="44:1-44:373"&gt;Time spent on Facebook competes with other leisure activities. If the hate speech and cat pictures website doesn‚Äôt work right now, you‚Äôll just try again later, whatever. You can just watch tv, read a book, or go for a walk instead. When Facebook goes down, it‚Äôs really not a big deal in the grand scheme of things. Most people will never notice that it happened.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-downtime" id="fnref-downtime" data-footnote-ref&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="46:1-46:361"&gt;By contrast, if my current employer has an availability incident, the entire internet explodes into paroxysms of rage because they can‚Äôt get their work done. It‚Äôs not an exageration to say that deliveries might not get made, factories might sit idle, etc, because GitHub is a &lt;em&gt;productive tool&lt;/em&gt;. There are things you can only accomplish because this tool exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-sourcepos="48:1-48:33"&gt;
&lt;a id="your-tools-make-what-you-ship" class="anchor" href="#your-tools-make-what-you-ship" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Your tools make what you ship&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="50:1-50:136"&gt;This distinction matters because these incentives towards availability percolate throughout your entire stack &amp;amp; architectural decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="52:1-52:328"&gt;If your React stack makes deployment more brittle, and you‚Äôve added multiple round trips of latency, and a widget fails to load for whatever reason, and the whole thing contrives to swallow errors ‚Äì Facebook has teams of people slaving away optimizing all of these steps, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; they have a way higher tolerance for messing up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="54:1-54:74"&gt;Move fast and break things!, is easy when &lt;em&gt;nobody cares that it‚Äôs broken&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="57:1-57:294"&gt;My employer promises its users three nines of uptime. I giggled at the idea of Facebook offering a service level agreement, and when I googled it in fact they explicitly say ‚Äúlol what SLA? sometimes when we deploy the API will go down for 5 minutes‚Äù.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-whatsapp-sla" id="fnref-whatsapp-sla" data-footnote-ref&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 5 minutes of downtime! Lmao.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="59:1-59:115"&gt;I live in a different world. Where I work, I work on real things that matter. And so do most programmers out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-sourcepos="61:1-61:17"&gt;
&lt;a id="in-conclusion" class="anchor" href="#in-conclusion" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;In conclusion,&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="63:1-63:139"&gt;Facebook should be considered harmful. Facebook‚Äôs devrel marketing is designed to ease their hiring pipeline and destroy their competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="65:1-65:29"&gt;Govern yourself accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes" data-footnotes&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-downtime"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="70:14-70:331"&gt;Of course if Facebook goes down‚Ä¶ &lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt; will be sad, cos Facebook will lose money. I suppose their customers (the advertisers) will be sad because their future sales trajectory will be impacted, but I bet even they don‚Äôt get that worked up about it. Ads that didn‚Äôt get displayed today can be displayed tomorrow. &lt;a href="#fnref-downtime" class="footnote-backref" data-footnote-backref aria-label="Back to content"&gt;‚Ü©&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-whatsapp-sla"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="68:18-68:309"&gt;‚ÄúWhen we update the API, you may experience up to 5 minutes of downtime.‚Äù / ‚ÄúWe do not currently offer commercially available product service level agreements for uptime and/or latency.‚Äù &lt;a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/support/#faq_775539867197306"&gt;https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/support/#faq_775539867197306&lt;/a&gt;, accessed 2024-04-22 &lt;a href="#fnref-whatsapp-sla" class="footnote-backref" data-footnote-backref aria-label="Back to content"&gt;‚Ü©&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-sourcepos="3:1-3:251"&gt;i recently had to grapple with how my work‚Äôs APIs handled authorization. our team wanted to do something slightly weird, and given my talents and knowledge of where the bodies are buried it fell to me to figure out how to do it safely &amp;amp; securely, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="5:1-5:300"&gt;now, the beating heart of GitHub is a sprawling, sixteen-year-old ruby on rails app so that is easier said than done,&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-rails" id="fnref-rails" data-footnote-ref&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but in theory who is allowed to read or write to this particular resource? ought to be a straight forward question. the system answers this literally millions of times a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="7:1-7:362"&gt;patiently reading code and docs has historically served me quite well, so i sat down and started reading. there was a lot of code and docs, though, and i spent weeks, and weeks, &lt;em&gt;and weeks&lt;/em&gt; on this question. eventually, i thought i had resolved it to my satisfaction, and wrote it up in a narrative i presented to my team. and everyone agreed that it made sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="9:1-9:34"&gt;but then a curious thing happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="11:1-11:256"&gt;i asked a former teammate of mine, an expert in this system, for a sanity check, and she pointed out that i had missed an important detail. the approach i had outlined in my doc was &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; correct, which is another way of saying that it could never work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="13:1-13:24"&gt;i went back to the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="15:1-15:426"&gt;and now every time i looked at some corner case, i seemed to find new quirks. someone would ask a perfectly sensible question that iluminated a corner of my ignorance. i struggled to explain what some of our automated tests &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be doing, and i kept finding new unexpected behaviour, lurking in a different part of the codebase i had either not read ‚Äì or had read many times before, but had yet been able to internalize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="17:1-17:410"&gt;i eventually realized, far too late, that the full set of behaviour that describes how the app handles authorization ‚Äì every nook and cranny, in its majestic entirety ‚Äì was simply too large to fit in my head all at once. or more likely, &lt;em&gt;anyone‚Äôs&lt;/em&gt; head. after over a decade of effort, rearchitecting for scale, handling new-use cases,&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-invariants" id="fnref-invariants" data-footnote-ref&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; etc, etc, the system had simply accreted too many details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="19:1-19:109"&gt;it has become a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/timothy-morton-hyperobjects-all-the-way-down/"&gt;hyperobject&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-sourcepos="21:1-21:689"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="21:2-21:689"&gt;Examples of hyperobjects include: black holes, oil spills, all plastic ever manufactured, capitalism, tectonic plates, and the solar system. Hyperobjects are often ancient or destined to be, like the sum total of Styrofoam and plutonium we have littered across the Earth over the past century, which will remain for millennia. A human being may see &lt;em&gt;evidence&lt;/em&gt; of hyperobjects‚Äîpollution here, a hurricane there‚Äîbut try gazing off into the distance to see the &lt;em&gt;totality&lt;/em&gt; of them, or to the very &lt;em&gt;end&lt;/em&gt; of them, and they disappear into a vanishing point. Hyperobjects, as Morton says, emerge only in fragments and patches that do not always seem to connect up from our view on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 data-sourcepos="23:1-23:13"&gt;
&lt;a id="well-duh" class="anchor" href="#well-duh" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;well, duh?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="25:1-25:42"&gt;in one sense, this observation is trivial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="27:1-27:300"&gt;our ruby on rails monolith alone, nevermind the dozens of services that connect to it, has seen hundreds and hundreds of engineers pour a lot of code into it. it is immediately apparent to all who clone the repository that the app as a whole is too vast and enormous for any one person to comprehend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="29:1-29:106"&gt;however, i had yet to grasp that even &lt;strong&gt;important subsets&lt;/strong&gt; of the app could also be beyond comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr data-sourcepos="31:1-32:0"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="33:1-33:221"&gt;around the same time, i came across &lt;a href="https://backofmind.substack.com/p/songs-my-portfolio-manager-taught-4fe"&gt;this entry in Dan Davies‚Äô newsletter&lt;/a&gt;, and here i will just quote the relevant passage in full (emphasis mine):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-sourcepos="35:1-35:101"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="35:2-35:101"&gt;Once upon a time, in the early to mid stages of the Global Financial Crisis, a client said to me ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-sourcepos="37:1-37:614"&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-sourcepos="37:2-37:614"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="37:7-37:614"&gt;‚ÄúDanny, since this thing began, there have been two types of analysts. Some people, like yourself, have been trying to develop their understanding of an incredibly complicated system, under huge pressure, absorbing vast amounts of technical detail in a short time, and doing a fairly good job of it. Others have just been mindless bomb-throwers, trying to attract attention to themselves with ill-informed displays of competitive panic. I decided early in this crisis that I was going to listen to the second type of analyst ‚Äì and they have turned out, systematically, to be much closer to being right‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-sourcepos="39:1-39:475"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="39:2-39:475"&gt;He was correct; I changed my approach as a result and consequently, I think, did a much better job of understanding the Eurocrisis. &lt;strong&gt;There‚Äôs a very great danger in believing that either a) the whole problem is of a size that you can fit in your head, so understanding it is just a matter of working hard enough, or that b) the relationship between the amount of detail you know and your understanding of the system is positive and monotonic.&lt;/strong&gt; This is often not the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="41:1-41:175"&gt;i‚Äôm still meditating on the meaning of this quote. i experienced it as a bit of a profound insight. i‚Äôve been meaning to track down Dan‚Äôs email so i can ask him more about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-sourcepos="43:1-43:12"&gt;
&lt;a id="now-what" class="anchor" href="#now-what" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;now what?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="45:1-45:288"&gt;at any rate, my work (my life) is filled with hyperobjects. i have to grapple with them all the time. not coincidentally, Dan is &lt;a href="https://profilebooks.com/work/the-unaccountability-machine/"&gt;working on a book on cybernetics&lt;/a&gt;, and it makes me think a lot about the ol‚Äô Stafford Beer quote,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-sourcepos="47:1-47:56"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="47:3-47:56"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The purpose of a system is what it does.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-posiwid" id="fnref-posiwid" data-footnote-ref&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="49:1-49:254"&gt;we can‚Äôt understand the whole system. nobody can take in every part and absorb every detail. and the intentions of any individual contributor are irrelevant. the only thing we can do is try to step outside and observe the actions it takes upon the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="51:1-51:113"&gt;i‚Äôm probably mixing metaphors. but! with the benefit of hindsight, how should i have tackled my research problem?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="53:1-53:265"&gt;i should‚Äôve ignored all of the code &amp;amp; first attacked the test suite. work backwards from those weird tests i struggled with. those tests describe the behaviour we actually see, at a high enough level to be useful. how it works under the hood kind of doesn‚Äôt matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="55:1-55:50"&gt;when wrestling a hyperobject, you kind of have to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul data-sourcepos="56:1-60:0"&gt;
&lt;li data-sourcepos="56:1-56:9"&gt;squint,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-sourcepos="57:1-57:21"&gt;suss out the vibes,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-sourcepos="58:1-58:49"&gt;don‚Äôt try to take it all in, because you can‚Äôt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-sourcepos="59:1-60:0"&gt;instead, measure the end result you can see; observe the outcomes, and use your intuition. what is the system trying to &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes" data-footnotes&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-rails"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="65:11-65:133"&gt;not, mind you, because it‚Äôs a rails app; a lot of people struggle with that fact, for some reason, but i‚Äôm not one of them. &lt;a href="#fnref-rails" class="footnote-backref" data-footnote-backref aria-label="Back to content"&gt;‚Ü©&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-invariants"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="61:16-61:263"&gt;the other day i came across Lorin‚Äôs post ‚Äú&lt;a href="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/2024/03/26/the-problem-with-invariants-is-that-they-change-over-time/"&gt;the problem with invariants is that they change over time&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù and its simple truth still makes me giggle. &lt;a href="#fnref-invariants" class="footnote-backref" data-footnote-backref aria-label="Back to content"&gt;‚Ü©&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-posiwid"&gt;

    <title>I've planted a garden üë©‚Äçüåæü™¥ü™ª</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p data-sourcepos="1:1-1:133"&gt;I‚Äôm adding a &lt;a href="/garden.html"&gt;garden section&lt;/a&gt; to this website,&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-garden" id="fnref-garden" data-footnote-ref&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; in the hope that I am able to make something interesting bloom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="3:1-3:176"&gt;I‚Äôve been enjoying Lu‚Äôs &lt;a href="https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/"&gt;wikiblogarden&lt;/a&gt;, and been feeling inspired by the idea of &lt;a href="https://www.tadiweb.com/"&gt;keeping a slippy mindset&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="5:1-5:576"&gt;For a long time I have been consumed with &lt;em&gt;hot takes&lt;/em&gt; and ideas that are too long to fit in a social media post, but not fleshed out enough to be a Full Thought Bearing The Full Weight of my Endorsement. That might sound like a weirdly high bar for my own rinky dink little personal website ‚Äì but once I started publishing &lt;a href="/2021/british-columbia-more-yimby-california.html"&gt;semi-novel housing research&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="/2018/rent-control-great-security-of-tenure.html"&gt;exhaustively footnoted treatises on rent control&lt;/a&gt;, it felt awkward to put out half-baked ideas in the same ‚Äúarea‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="7:1-7:56"&gt;And so those ideas languished, with nowhere to put them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="9:1-9:227"&gt;A separate section is an attempt to break that feeling of awkwardness. I‚Äôd like to experiment with writing &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; silly and semi-serious ideas, in the hopes that those ideas either grow or, together, form an interesting corpus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes" data-footnotes&gt;

&lt;li id="fn-garden"&gt;

    <title>Good News: We Can Fix Traffic Safety!</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;figure id="fref:fig1"&gt;
&lt;a href="/2021/good-news-we-can-fix-traffic-safety/files/conversion-st-paul.png"&gt;&lt;img src="/2021/good-news-we-can-fix-traffic-safety/files/conversion-st-paul.png" title="The Conversion of Saint Paul by Palma il Giovane, 1595." style="max-width:100%;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The Conversion of Saint Paul&lt;/i&gt; by Palma il Giovane, 1595.
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="8:1-8:147"&gt;We suffer from many hard collective action problems whose solution requires coordination across local, regional, national and international actors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="10:1-10:64"&gt;For example, there is no individual person I can yell at to fix:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul data-sourcepos="12:1-16:0"&gt;
&lt;li data-sourcepos="12:1-12:16"&gt;climate change&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-sourcepos="13:1-13:28"&gt;income &amp;amp; wealth inequality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-sourcepos="14:1-14:23"&gt;daylight savings time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-sourcepos="15:1-16:0"&gt;to say nothing of public transit, affordable housing, police brutality, truth and reconciliation, and so on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="17:1-17:241"&gt;No individual elected representative of mine can take a single vote, on a singular legislative item, that will meaningfully address any of these problems in one fell swoop. Life is hard. Working on these problems is many lifetimes of effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="19:1-19:73"&gt;That said, I have &lt;strong&gt;extremely good news&lt;/strong&gt; I would like to share with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="21:1-21:369"&gt;There is &lt;strong&gt;one problem&lt;/strong&gt; that we suffer from, a problem that stares us in the face every day. A problem that kills people all the time. A problem that horrifically maims innocent children on a near-daily basis. And, it is a problem which, in fact, an individual elected representative of mine could meaningfully address, in a single vote on a singular legislative item.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="23:1-23:35"&gt;That problem is &lt;strong&gt;traffic safety&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="25:1-25:347"&gt;Unlike housing or wealth inequality or climate change, traffic safety is actually almost entirely in control of my local municipality. My city councillor doesn‚Äôt have jurisdiction over air pollution, or carbon taxes, or whether we roll back the clocks. But the city of Toronto does have jurisdiction over how my local roads are designed and built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="27:1-27:66"&gt;A single dinner party‚Äôs worth of people could, with a single vote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul data-sourcepos="28:1-31:0"&gt;
&lt;li data-sourcepos="28:1-28:163"&gt;create a new, default, standard for road and street design which prioritizes pedestrian safety, and which is applied to all new future road works across the city&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-sourcepos="29:1-29:143"&gt;immediately begin adding new bike lanes, reducing road widths, adding speed bumps, and even close roads off to cars altogether where possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-sourcepos="30:1-31:0"&gt;dramatically make new and substantial progress and change the city for the better, for decades to come.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="32:1-32:319"&gt;It would barely cost any money up front, and it would save tons of money in the long run. It would save scores of lives, whether killed outright or forever altered by terrible injuries. It would reduce pollution. It would improve the quality of our lives. It would make a small dent towards ameliorating climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="34:1-34:194"&gt;So, why can‚Äôt we make progress on that front? What could we change? What if we took this challenge seriously? City council recently got cut down to 26 people. You only need 14 people to say yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="36:1-36:221"&gt;I think the reason is we‚Äôve forgotten how to ask. I think we‚Äôve forgotten how to make some noise. I think we‚Äôve forgotten how to get real fucking inconvenient. I think we‚Äôve forgotten how to imagine the future we deserve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="38:1-38:191"&gt;I think if we talk to our neighbours, if we get a little organized, if we start blocking streets during rush hour, if we make a big fucking fuss about it, I think we could make some progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="40:1-40:172"&gt;All in all, I feel optimistic. This is &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; news. There is a terrible problem that you can help improve dramatically if you yell at a single person, over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="42:1-42:43"&gt;In this day and age, how wonderful is that?&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>British Columbia is YIMBYer than California</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;h3 data-sourcepos="1:1-1:120"&gt;
&lt;a id="comparing-new-dwelling-building-permits-per-capita-per-year-between-select-us-states-and-select-canadian-provinces" class="anchor" href="#comparing-new-dwelling-building-permits-per-capita-per-year-between-select-us-states-and-select-canadian-provinces" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Comparing new dwelling building permits per capita per year between select U.S. states and select Canadian provinces&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="3:1-3:230"&gt;Canada is downstream of American culture, and Canadian housing discourse is no different. In the great, fiery, online fights about housing, Californians in particular are over-represented and tend to drive the terms of the debate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="5:1-5:330"&gt;And so, when it comes to our own online twitter housing discourse, many Canadians have noticeably ‚ÄúCalifornian‚Äù terms of reference. Namely, folks tend to adopt a semi-reductive fixation on the supply of private market housing, which is being severely stifled by excessive deference to the interests of incumbent, NIMBY homeowners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="7:1-7:147"&gt;This is fine as far as stylized causal narratives go. But if we‚Äôve adopted the same causal narratives, how do our housing markets actually compare?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="9:1-9:62"&gt;In other words, how bad are &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; NIMBYs, relatively speaking?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="11:1-11:203"&gt;On close examination, using new dwelling building permits as a proxy for new housing construction, I find that on average Canadian provinces produce way more housing than California or New York state do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="13:1-13:174"&gt;&lt;a href="/2021/british-columbia-more-yimby-california/files/average-bldg-permits-2011-2020.png" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="/2021/british-columbia-more-yimby-california/files/average-bldg-permits-2011-2020.png" alt="Average building permits for new dwellings per year per 1,000 residents in 2011-2020" style="max-width:100%;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="15:1-15:172"&gt;(Click &lt;a href="/2021/british-columbia-more-yimby-california/files/comparing-building-permits-per-capita-between-america-canada.phillmv.xlsx"&gt;here for a copy of the spreadsheets&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="17:1-17:191"&gt;For the average California YIMBY, the status quo in British Columbia is a &lt;em&gt;success condition&lt;/em&gt;: BC on average issues three times more building permits per capita per year than California does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-sourcepos="19:1-19:13"&gt;
&lt;a id="motivation" class="anchor" href="#motivation" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="21:1-21:489"&gt;In 2017, I became somewhat familiar with Canadian housing statistics and academic literature, and one thing I learned while &lt;a href="http://okayfail.com/2018/rent-control-great-security-of-tenure.html"&gt;writing about rent control&lt;/a&gt; is that every jurisdiction manages to do things differently. As I continued to see American commentators cite Toronto and Vancouver as positive examples worth emulating, I developed a vibe that our housing crisis must have some important qualitative differences, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="23:1-23:308"&gt;In particular, I was fairly confident that Canadian cities produce a lot more housing, relatively speaking, than their American counterparts. The other day I got into a twitter conversation with &lt;a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/"&gt;Jens von Bergmann&lt;/a&gt;, and it occurred to me that I could try to sketch this out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-sourcepos="25:1-25:13"&gt;
&lt;a id="hypothesis" class="anchor" href="#hypothesis" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Hypothesis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="27:1-27:163"&gt;If Canadian cities produce more housing, relatively speaking, than similar American cities, then this should stand out if we compare their construction statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="29:1-29:424"&gt;Housing regulations are highly localized and so ideally we‚Äôd compare individual cities directly. But when making international comparisons definitions like ‚Äúwhat is a city?‚Äù can get pretty flimsy. Also, we‚Äôre just interested in the general picture. These kinds of differences ought to show up at the sub-regional level, and entities like provinces or U.S. states tend to have more stable definitions than metropolitan areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="31:1-31:339"&gt;Because provinces and states have different sizes, comparing absolute numbers isn‚Äôt particularly meaningful. We‚Äôll need to normalize housing unit construction statistics by each area‚Äôs respective population. Also, housing construction rates can vary a lot on any given year, so we‚Äôll have to average our statistics across a bunch of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-sourcepos="33:1-33:14"&gt;
&lt;a id="methodology" class="anchor" href="#methodology" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Methodology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="35:1-35:131"&gt;An important caveat is I had to time box this analysis to two hours, which is all the time I had while the baby slept.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-time-spent" id="fnref-time-spent" data-footnote-ref&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="37:1-37:264"&gt;OK! Let‚Äôs find some data. We are interested in the regulatory bottleneck to new housing, so I figured we could use new housing starts, which are easy to get from the CMHC website. All I had to do now was to find a source of new housing starts data for U.S. states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="39:1-39:498"&gt;I searched for variants on ‚Äúcalifornia housing starts statistics‚Äù for a good half an hour without finding anything useful. I was surprised there‚Äôs no equivalent to our reasonably decent StatCan website. There‚Äôs a &lt;a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/HOUST"&gt;FRED table&lt;/a&gt; but seemingly no way to break it down by state. There‚Äôs the &lt;a href="https://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/index.html"&gt;New Residential Construction&lt;/a&gt; data release, but the only available breakdowns are by region and not by state. Weird!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="41:1-41:432"&gt;Surely I‚Äôm missing something? American researchers seem to have access to all sorts of interesting surveys and data series on rental prices and residential construction that we lack. Maybe data is only aggregated on a state by state level; maybe you need to know a guy to get it. Either way, I couldn‚Äôt find any one-stop-shop portals with historical data on housing starts or completions with state-level (or MSA-level) granularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="43:1-43:427"&gt;What I did find was the &lt;a href="https://www.census.gov/construction/bps/"&gt;Building Permits Survey&lt;/a&gt;, which should be a rough proxy for actual building starts.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-building-starts" id="fnref-building-starts" data-footnote-ref&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Poking thru StatCan yielded &lt;a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/cv.action?pid=3410006601"&gt;Table 34-10-0066-01  Building permits, by type of structure and type of work (x 1,000)&lt;/a&gt; whose definition seems to be roughly equivalent to the American one. Great!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="45:1-45:243"&gt;I filtered the StatCan table down to ‚ÄòTotal residential‚Äô and ‚ÄòNumber of dwelling units-created‚Äô. The Canadian building permits table only went back to 2011, so I arbitrarily decided that 2011-2020 was a good enough time period to average over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="47:1-47:256"&gt;On a whim, I decided to compare the four largest Canadian provinces (Ontario, Qu√©bec, British Columbia, Alberta) with the four largest U.S. states (California, Texas, Florida, New York) plus Washington which is sort of like, a mirror-universe BC, why not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="49:1-49:477"&gt;I then got population estimates from &lt;a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/cv.action?pid=1710000501"&gt;Table 17-10-0005-01  Population estimates on July 1st, by age and sex&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?id=NYPOP,CAPOP,TXPOP,WAPOP,FLPOP"&gt;{NY,CA,TX,WA,FL}POP data series from FRED&lt;/a&gt;. By using population figures for each individual year for each given state/province should allow us to account for differences in population growth across different state/provinces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="51:1-51:403"&gt;Finally, I dumped all of these tables into Excel, chopped things around, divided the number of issued permits by the number of people in each state or province, multiplied that number by one thousand, and then finally averaged every year together. You can find &lt;a href="/2021/british-columbia-more-yimby-california/files/comparing-building-permits-per-capita-between-america-canada.phillmv.xlsx"&gt;the data here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a id="concluding-thoughts--questions" class="anchor" href="#concluding-thoughts--questions" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Concluding thoughts &amp;amp; questions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p data-sourcepos="56:1-56:214"&gt;No. Not every building permit turns into a housing start, and not every housing start turns into a housing completion. Actual finished housing units are some large fraction of the number of issued building permits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="58:1-58:144"&gt;It‚Äôs entirely possible that for ex. jurisdiction A approves a lot more housing than jurisdiction B but actually builds a smaller fraction of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-sourcepos="60:1-60:50"&gt;
&lt;a id="what-does-this-say-about-the-housing-shortage" class="anchor" href="#what-does-this-say-about-the-housing-shortage" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What does this say about the housing shortage?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="62:1-62:131"&gt;The only concrete observation we can make here is that Canadian provinces tend to issue more building permits than American states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="64:1-64:231"&gt;British Columbia may issue three times the permits per capita that California does, but as long as the demand for housing is higher in British Columbia than it is in California, then prices will continue to be out of whack.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-weird" id="fnref-weird" data-footnote-ref&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-sourcepos="68:1-68:255"&gt;That said, I think we can also note that while Canadian jurisdictions may have a NIMBY problem, whatever we do experience here is &lt;em&gt;very different&lt;/em&gt; from what our American friends are experiencing. Their situation seems to be a lot worse!&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-familiar-refrain" id="fnref-familiar-refrain" data-footnote-ref&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-time-spent"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="78:16-78:161"&gt;For what it‚Äôs worth, I spent two hours gathering the data, two hours making the graph look pretty, and another three hours writing this blog post. &lt;a href="#fnref-time-spent" class="footnote-backref" data-footnote-backref aria-label="Back to content"&gt;‚Ü©&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-building-starts"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="72:21-72:144"&gt;In fact, I later learned that the CMHC‚Äôs building starts data builds upon the building permits data. So, it‚Äôs all connected. &lt;a href="#fnref-building-starts" class="footnote-backref" data-footnote-backref aria-label="Back to content"&gt;‚Ü©&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-weird"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="76:11-76:87"&gt;That‚Äôs kind of weird, though, right? No shade on BC but California is &lt;em&gt;nice&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href="#fnref-weird" class="footnote-backref" data-footnote-backref aria-label="Back to content"&gt;‚Ü©&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-familiar-refrain"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="74:22-74:124"&gt;Canadians will recognize the familiar refrain; sure, we got problems, but at least we‚Äôre not &lt;em&gt;America&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href="#fnref-familiar-refrain" class="footnote-backref" data-footnote-backref aria-label="Back to content"&gt;‚Ü©&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
