    <title>I Met Paul Graham Once</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p data-sourcepos="1:1-1:346"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nota bene: I’ve had a rough 2025 so far. I’m worried that people who used to support, or at least tolerate me, will turn against me out of a desire to conform, to show their obeisance, to the current prevailing winds. I found myself writing this essay to explain why I’ve been feeling so miserable. I sent it to Paul before I published it here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="3:1-3:23"&gt;I met Paul Graham once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="5:1-5:217"&gt;It was the summer of 2015, and we were attending Y Combinator, the premier finishing school for startup founders. It was a long and stressful summer, holed up in our apartment in Mountain View, and a great experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="7:1-7:44"&gt;We benefitted immensely from our time there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="9:1-9:322"&gt;At Y Combinator, there was sort of a curriculum, but they didn’t teach you anything per se. You’re assigned mentors, who you meet weekly, and you are free to book office hours – thirty minutes at a time – with a rotating cast of partners, each and every one of them formidable people, near or at the top of the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="11:1-11:74"&gt;The mentors applied a neat and very effective trick: they believed in you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="13:1-13:250"&gt;Out of thousands of applicants, you had been chosen, plucked from obscurity, and flown out, and now you were here, in the centre of the (software) universe. They had invested in you, you personally, above and beyond your specific idea for a business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="15:1-15:182"&gt;Now every week you spoke with them, and presented your metrics, and discussed your problems, and, well, you could be doing better, couldn’t you? These results, they were kind of mid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="17:1-17:299"&gt;They didn’t boss us around, or tell us what to do, but we didn’t want to disappoint teacher. Their approval meant a lot. Doors would open. Success was at our fingertips: the summer culminated in Demo Day, a cattle call where we would be presented to investors, and our future might change forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="19:1-19:214"&gt;We worked harder. We learned how to hustle. We swallowed rejection. We doubled our efforts, bent over our desks, working until we could barely see straight, trying to figure out how to &lt;em&gt;make something people want&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr data-sourcepos="21:1-22:0"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="23:1-23:255"&gt;One day, we booked a meeting with pg (Paul Graham). He had just retired from the day to day running of the show, handed the reigns over to sama (Sam Altman), and now roamed the halls as an elder statesmen, a congenial and affable uncle, dispensing advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="25:1-25:443"&gt;We were excited. I don’t think he was ever a &lt;em&gt;hero&lt;/em&gt; of mine, but he certainly had influence, made a big impression on me. I had read his essays eight or nine years earlier, during my undergraduate, hunched over a screen in my university’s computer lab, nodding along. I spent way too much time on hackernews. Lisp was cool, I was special for just taking an interest in startups and software, we could do anything if we worked hard enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="27:1-27:142"&gt;We explained our pitch to him: Appcanary monitors your apps and servers, and lets you know when you’re affected by a security vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="29:1-29:278"&gt;He thought it was a decent enough idea, but the name, Appcanary, he wasn’t crazy about the name. He was very good at naming companies. He thought about it and told us that, really, we ought to be named Oracle, that would be a great name for us. Descriptive, simple, memorable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="31:1-31:27"&gt;Shame it was taken, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="33:1-33:78"&gt;We nodded and thanked him, and laughed about it later. No one bats a thousand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr data-sourcepos="35:1-36:0"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="37:1-37:41"&gt;YC had a huge positive impact on my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="39:1-39:174"&gt;People took us more seriously now. Before we were randos, misfits even, but now we were Princes of the Universe. We had rubbed shoulders with royalty, or at least sovereigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="41:1-41:87"&gt;Someone had believed in us, and pushed us until we understood how to make our own luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="43:1-43:360"&gt;We grew a lot that summer, but we didn’t raise that much money. A bit, enough to keep us going. I loved California, I liked San Francisco, but I didn’t feel comfortable trying to live there. I felt gross being part of a monied class in a city rapidly hollowing out. I’d had a precarious childhood and early adulthood, and I craved some kind of stability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="45:1-45:276"&gt;Back home, we lived in the Best Neighbourhood in the Last Affordable Apartment In West Toronto. We knew it would reduce our chances for success, but it would double our runway. In the winter, I had started dating this most amazing girl, and I wanted to see where it would go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="47:1-47:423"&gt;Two years later, we realized that everyone thought our product was useful but not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; useful. We could get people to pay us hundreds of dollars per month, but not thousands. That’s the death knell of a vc-backed b2b saas sales model. High-touch sales to large companies is not worth it unless you can score thousands of dollars per month. We were too burnt out to pivot to another business idea, and we quietly folded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="49:1-49:490"&gt;It was good timing: almost immediately after, GitHub announced they were going to provide our startup’s features &lt;strong&gt;for free&lt;/strong&gt;. We gave them a call, we got them excited. They “acquihired” us as subject matter experts, and paid us a small fee for the intellectual property. We returned something like 40 or 45 cents on the dollar to our investors. Not a great result, but about par for the course. Most startups fail. Some of our Summer 2015 cohort flamed out faster, or more spectacularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="51:1-51:95"&gt;One of our investors commended us for our ethical behaviour – not everyone returns the money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr data-sourcepos="53:1-54:0"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="55:1-55:137"&gt;It’s been almost ten years. After we got hired, Microsoft bought GitHub. I’m still with that amazing girl. We have two kids, a house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="57:1-57:22"&gt;I’m transgender now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="59:1-59:423"&gt;It turns out that I like women so much I’d like to be one of them. Or as close as I can get. I’m happier now, more joyful. I feel in touch with my body, and how I move through the world, in ways I didn’t before. Up until very recently, very few people would confuse me for a woman. It took me a while to remove my facial hair, I still haven’t trained my voice. That’s OK. What is a woman, exactly? I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="61:1-61:258"&gt;I don’t want to make anyone uncomfortable. For that reason, I like to say that I am “non-binary trans femme”. It’s a mouthful, I know. But asking to be called “they” feels less burdensome, less of a polite fiction, than to ask to be called “she”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="63:1-63:92"&gt;I just want to be treated with respect, and kindness. I don’t think I’m asking for much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="65:1-65:77"&gt;Why is it wrong for me to have more joy in my life? I’m not hurting anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr data-sourcepos="67:1-68:0"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="69:1-69:65"&gt;A few days ago, Paul Graham published an essay on “Wokeness”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="71:1-71:436"&gt;I skimmed it. I couldn’t finish reading it, it made me too upset. It came a few days after Mark Zuckerberg announced he was going to increase the hate speech people like me receive. It’s not OK to imply someone has a mental disability – unless it’s because they’re queer. He also quietly removed some trivial accomodations he had made for his transgender employees.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-accomodations" id="fnref-accomodations" data-footnote-ref&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;  &lt;em&gt;That&lt;/em&gt; stung. That felt personal, targeted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="75:1-75:93"&gt;I’ve been feeling quite anxious ever since. It feels like the world is crumbling around me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="77:1-77:352"&gt;I’m still not sure what pg thinks “Wokeness” means.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-performative" id="fnref-performative" data-footnote-ref&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I know for a fact, that for most people – including many of the people he hangs out with – it just means “left-wing thing I dislike”. I got the impression that he thinks it’s bad, and that companies should purge people who are too woke. Maybe I’m being unfair to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="81:1-81:255"&gt;The irony is I too dislike nagging, hollow, corporate DEI exercises. In the abstract I was glad they existed&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-dei" id="fnref-dei" data-footnote-ref&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but the insincerity was palpable. Are “identity politics” just a status game that economically advantaged elites play? I could be convinced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr data-sourcepos="85:1-86:0"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="87:1-87:161"&gt;In the 2021 novel “Detransition Baby” the author shares a joke. Transgender women only have one of three jobs: computer programmer, aesthetician, prostitute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="89:1-89:518"&gt;It’s an old joke. More of an observation, really. The director of “Vestidas de Azul”, &lt;a href="https://thefilmstage.com/dressed-in-blue-review-a-long-lost-essential-document-of-spanish-and-lgbtqi-cinema-history-gets-new-life/"&gt;a 1983 documentary about trans women in Madrid&lt;/a&gt;, had hoped to make a movie about trans women who were lawyers or held important roles in society. Instead he discovered that most trans women were &lt;strong&gt;forced&lt;/strong&gt; to be artists, hair dressers, or sex workers – so that’s who he made his movie about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="91:1-91:79"&gt;I’m glad I can be a computer programmer; no one gets to be an artist anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="93:1-93:223"&gt;If you haven’t met many trans women, that might sound over-the-top, hyperbolic. But for so long, people like me were strongly discriminated against. Until very recently, we were treated as bywords for freaks, or psycopaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="95:1-95:239"&gt;In this vein, the other day I saw a scorching, sizzling hot take on Mastodon that read something like: the reason why conservative women are so mad about trans women is because they don’t want to share washrooms with the sex slave caste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr data-sourcepos="97:1-98:0"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="99:1-99:255"&gt;The reason why pg’s essay made me so upset, made me feel so dispirited, is because I benefitted directly from his largesse, from a system he set up. His “school” took a chance on me, taught me how to hustle, how to become a Princess of the Universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="101:1-101:73"&gt;I’m immensely glad for the opportunity. Would I receive it again today?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="103:1-103:262"&gt;In many people’s imagination, the word “woke” invokes someone exactly like me. I’m the person who is annoying about their pronouns. I’m the person who feels more comfortable using gender neutral bathrooms.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-bathrooms" id="fnref-bathrooms" data-footnote-ref&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I have a passing interest in social justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="107:1-107:476"&gt;I’m concerned he, or rather, the people who succeeded him, would take one look at me, and decide that I am “too woke”, whatever that means. I worry that my existence, that my living in joy, in a state of grace, is “too woke” to be worth employing. I’m certain he wouldn’t be rude to my face, but he might quietly discriminate against me, say no thanks. He might not even think of it as discrimination, only that I don’t have what it takes. Whatever that means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="109:1-109:70"&gt;I think this is why the current turn in the industry is so unsettling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="111:1-111:635"&gt;It’s mean, and unkind. It’s malicious. Moves like Mark’s, and essays like pg’s, create the permission structure for people to discriminate against me. I’ve already been pushed out of Twitter; the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/sep/05/racism-misogyny-lies-how-did-x-become-so-full-of-hatred-and-is-it-ethical-to-keep-using-it"&gt;hate speech&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2024/05/24/twitter-considers-cisgender-a-slur-and-moderates-it-over-actual-slurs/"&gt;censorship&lt;/a&gt; was too much to deal with. A lot of people feel that treating someone like me with respect is just a trendy moral fashion.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-conventionally-minded" id="fnref-conventionally-minded" data-footnote-ref&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="115:1-115:164"&gt;Will my next promotion be silently denied? Will a coworker try to disrespect me out of spite? Will I be shut out of big tech? Will anyone invest in my next startup?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="117:1-117:117"&gt;I’m better at my job than most. I’d be a better startup founder today than I was in 2015. None of that will matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="119:1-119:206"&gt;It feels as if people like pg, or at least people he hangs out with, who once upon a time believed in me, who lifted me up, recognized my talent, would now prefer that I be relegated to the sex slave caste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="121:1-121:9"&gt;It hurts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes" data-footnotes&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-accomodations"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="73:19-73:538"&gt;As reported by the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/10/technology/meta-mark-zuckerberg-trump.html"&gt;nytimes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;That same day at Meta’s offices in Silicon Valley, Texas and New York, facilities managers were instructed to remove tampons from men’s bathrooms, which the company had provided for nonbinary and transgender employees who use the men’s room and who may have required sanitary pads, two employees said.&lt;/blockquote&gt; Why go out of your way to remove them? Do tampons drain your masculine energy? &lt;a href="#fnref-accomodations" class="footnote-backref" data-footnote-backref aria-label="Back to content"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-performative"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="79:18-79:404"&gt;He does provide a definition: an aggressively performative focus on social justice. Who decides what is a “performative” focus? That seems to be the question. All sorts of things are a “performance”, cf Judith Butler. Artifacts – our art, our technology, our material culture – express politics, cf Langdon Winner. Racism is bad, but you musn’t be annoying about it? It’s incoherent. &lt;a href="#fnref-performative" class="footnote-backref" data-footnote-backref aria-label="Back to content"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-dei"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="83:9-83:78"&gt;A small minority of people really do need to be taught how to be kind. &lt;a href="#fnref-dei" class="footnote-backref" data-footnote-backref aria-label="Back to content"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-bathrooms"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="105:15-105:213"&gt;In bathrooms, sometimes men flinch when they see me, afraid that they walked in through the wrong door. In an airport, it can be charming, affirming even. In a bar with drunk people, it can be scary. &lt;a href="#fnref-bathrooms" class="footnote-backref" data-footnote-backref aria-label="Back to content"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-conventionally-minded"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="113:27-113:215"&gt;Some frame this as the “aggressively conventional-minded” shutting down free inquiry. I ask you, is there &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; more “aggressively independent-minded” than being gender-non-conforming? &lt;a href="#fnref-conventionally-minded" class="footnote-backref" data-footnote-backref aria-label="Back to content"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

    <title>Everyone Transitions</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;h1 data-sourcepos="1:1-1:22"&gt;
&lt;a id="everyone-transitions" class="anchor" href="#everyone-transitions" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Everyone Transitions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="3:1-3:132"&gt;People make a big deal out of transitioning &lt;a href="https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/health/transition/in-slow-motion/"&gt;your gender&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="5:1-5:230"&gt;Some people will call you brave, and others will threaten you with violence. Your friends and family might throw you a party, while your romantic partner might experience full on grief, and sit shiva for the person you used to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="7:1-7:68"&gt;It’s like a whole thing, but it doesn’t have to be. Here’s the deal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="9:1-9:118"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everyone&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;transitions&lt;/em&gt;. Let’s say that again. Everyone transitions. Everyone is transitioning, present continuous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="11:1-11:275"&gt;To transition your gender is to make a leap of faith. It’s a one way door. You won’t know what it’s like, if it’s worth it, until long after you jump, until after you’ve made irreversible changes. It’s just like moving to another country, quitting your job, or having a baby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="13:1-13:186"&gt;The only constant is change, and all of us are always changing all of the time. To live is to change, for only death is immutable – and even then you spend a lot of time rotting first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="15:1-15:211"&gt;You are not the man your wife married all those years ago (that guy had more hair). Your closet is full of dresses you don’t feel like wearing anymore. You used to be really into nu metal, but… now you’re not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="17:1-17:63"&gt;Yesterday, you were a baby and tomorrow you will be a babushka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="19:1-19:53"&gt;That’s life! You only live once, make the best of it.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>What is the point of the Liberal party?</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;h1 data-sourcepos="1:1-1:41"&gt;
&lt;a id="what-is-the-point-of-the-liberal-party" class="anchor" href="#what-is-the-point-of-the-liberal-party" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What is the point of the Liberal party?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="3:1-3:74"&gt;Here is my problem: why does Justin Trudeau even &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to govern anymore?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="5:1-5:227"&gt;As I write this, Trudeau is on the verge of stepping down, the dam has broken, his time is up, so fine – but I was thinking about this question six months ago. You can repeat this question for Bonnie Crombie, here in Ontario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="7:1-7:294"&gt;(What does Bonnie Crombie want to do &lt;a href="https://www.thestar.com/politics/provincial/crombies-liberals-pledge-income-tax-breaks-that-they-say-doug-ford-has-failed-to-deliver/article_d014448a-a0f1-11ef-8c77-436b262bf60d.html"&gt;other than cut taxes&lt;/a&gt;? We already have a party that likes to cut taxes.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="9:1-9:69"&gt;What do Liberals want to accomplish? What do they want to govern for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="11:1-11:413"&gt;It’s not to do electoral reform. It’s not to expand social assistance. They had to be dragged kicking and screaming to expand pharmacare. It’s not to give rights to workers. It’s not to fix the housing crisis. They’re not radically expanding public transit. They’re not breaking up the oligarchies that rule our lives, or reducing inequality. They’ve been reduced to limping along on climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="13:1-13:137"&gt;I am extremely thankful for legal weed, the canada child benefit, some modest daycare reform, and I think the carbon tax was a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="15:1-15:154"&gt;I obviously &lt;em&gt;prefer&lt;/em&gt; to have them in government than the “destroy everything that is nice and good and reward our cronies” alternative currently on offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="17:1-17:106"&gt;But why run? What’s the point? What’s the agenda? What else do you &lt;strong&gt;want to do&lt;/strong&gt; while in government?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="19:1-19:304"&gt;I could forgive the insufferable smarm these people exhibit at every opportunity if they were &lt;em&gt;competent&lt;/em&gt;, if they were good at their jobs, if there were mandarins in smoke filled rooms secretly pulling strings in a game of 4d chess. But it turns out, again and again, that given the ball they fumble it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="21:1-21:483"&gt;Look at &lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/canada-post-strike-recap-1.7409424"&gt;the Canada Post strike&lt;/a&gt;. Who won from that? If you were going to force workers back to work all along, why wait four weeks? Retailers got screwed, workers got screwed, the government looks bad, and the only winner here is the management at Canada Post, who refused to negotiate because they knew this would happen. &lt;em&gt;Those&lt;/em&gt; people will drift off to their next job being able to brag about cowing their union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="23:1-23:107"&gt;All of this just to protect a having subclass of part-time workers who are more exploited than full timers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="25:1-25:188"&gt;There’s no vision for the country. There’s just more of the same, keeping the lights on, protecting the status quo even as everyone agrees that it sucks, it’s untenable, it’s broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="27:1-27:115"&gt;Is it any wonder that people aren’t excited to go out and vote? YOU NEED TO MAKE PEOPLE EXCITED TO GO OUT AND VOTE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="29:1-29:108"&gt;What is the point of the Liberal party? I have some answers to this question but they’re all unflattering.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>UIs Should Be Versioned, Just Like We Version APIs</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;h1 data-sourcepos="1:1-1:52"&gt;
&lt;a id="uis-should-be-versioned-just-like-we-version-apis" class="anchor" href="#uis-should-be-versioned-just-like-we-version-apis" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;UIs Should Be Versioned, Just Like We Version APIs&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="3:1-3:389"&gt;Every organization that offers an application programming interface almost immediately starts to version it. APIs are essentially contracts between us, service providers, and our users. The bargain is you build your app using our service in some presumably mutually beneficial arrangement, and in exchange we promise to give you a stable platform atop which you will construct your dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="5:1-5:522"&gt;Everyone agrees that it is extremely rude to break an API. Changing APIs unexpectedly makes our users sad because their robots will break, and they will be forced to waste time and energy figuring out whatever broke. To prevent this, we version our APIs. Versions are clauses in this contract: we say, this is &lt;code&gt;v1&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;v2&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;20241231&lt;/code&gt; or whatever, and we hereby promise to not change it. Should you want to use latest and greatest features, you are free to upgrade at your leisure. Or not don’t upgrade, that’s fine too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="7:1-7:41"&gt;Why don’t we do this for user interfaces?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="9:1-9:230"&gt;We &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; version UIs, but we don’t.  We change UIs constantly, remorselessly. Every reason for providing stable interfaces applies just as well for &lt;em&gt;human beings&lt;/em&gt; as they do for robots – but somehow we only respect the robots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="11:1-11:137"&gt;Why is that? Pure vibes but I feel like the reason ultimately is that we, the computer industry, hate people and wish for them to suffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="13:1-13:135"&gt;👉 There’s absolutely &lt;strong&gt;no reason&lt;/strong&gt; why we can’t show the same care and attention to how changes impact our UIs as we do to our APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="15:1-15:348"&gt;We have zero respect for the effort humans have to put into learning interfaces, and we actively destroy any skills they may have painfully acquired for using the tools we gave them. You can spend a lifetime learning how to use a paint brush, a knife or a needle more skillfully, and be rewarded for it with efficiency and expertise.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-not-original" id="fnref-not-original" data-footnote-ref&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="17:1-17:214"&gt;Yet once a computer is involved a programmer somewhere will unthinkingly destroy all of that built up skill every 24-36 months just because &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_design"&gt;it’s no longer fashionable&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="19:1-19:172"&gt;Anyways, I was reminded of this while &lt;a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/never-forgive-them/"&gt;reading this depressing and correct essay by Ed Zitron about our dystopian present&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-sourcepos="21:1-21:488"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="21:2-21:488"&gt;The tools we use in our daily lives outside of our devices have mostly stayed the same. While buttons on our cars might have moved around […] we generally have a brake, an accelerator, a wheel, and a turn signal. Boarding an airplane has worked mostly the same way since I started flying, other than moving from physical tickets to digital ones. We’re not expected to work out “the new way to use a toilet” every few months because somebody decided we were finishing too quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-sourcepos="23:1-23:333"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="23:2-23:333"&gt;Yet our apps and the platforms we use every day operate by a totally different moral and intellectual compass. While the idea of an update is fairly noble… many tech platforms see it as a means to further extract and exploit, to push users into doing things that either keep them on the app longer or take more-profitable actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-sourcepos="25:1-25:594"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="25:2-25:594"&gt;We as a society need to reckon with how this twists us up, makes us more paranoid, more judgmental, more aggressive, more reactionary, because when everything is subtly annoying, we all simmer and suffer in manifold ways. There is no digital world and physical world — they are, and have been, the same for quite some time, and reporting on tech as if this isn’t the case fails the user. It may seem a little dramatic, but take a second and really think about how many little digital irritations you deal with in a day. It’s time to wake up to the fact that our digital lives are rotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-sourcepos="27:1-27:218"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="27:2-27:218"&gt;I’m not talking about one single product or company, but most digital experiences. The interference is everywhere, and we’ve all learned to accept conditions that are, when written out plainly, are kind of insane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-sourcepos="29:1-29:4"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="29:2-29:4"&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-sourcepos="31:1-31:374"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="31:3-31:374"&gt;Earlier in the year, smart speaker company Sonos released a redesign of its app that removed accessibility features and the ability to edit song queues or play music from your phone in an attempt to “modernize” the interface, with WIRED suggesting that the changes could potentially open the door to adding a subscription of some sort to help Sonos’ ailing growth…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-sourcepos="33:1-33:579"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="33:2-33:579"&gt;Now, what’s important to accept here is that absolutely none of this is done with any real consideration of the wider effects on the customer, as long as the customer continues doing the things that the company needs them to. We, as people, have been trained to accept a kind of digital transience — an inherent knowledge that things will change at random, that the changes may suck, and that we will just have to accept them because that’s how the computer works, and these companies work hard to suppress competition as a means of making sure they can do what they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="35:1-35:61"&gt;the end that’s the tweet full stop &lt;a href="/tags/antihumanism"&gt;#antihumanism&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="/tags/programming"&gt;#programming&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>they’re going to build camps</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;h1 data-sourcepos="1:1-1:32"&gt;
&lt;a id="theyre-going-to-build-camps" class="anchor" href="#theyre-going-to-build-camps" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;they’re going to build camps&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="3:1-3:308"&gt;the day after The 2024 Election, i happened to be in berlin. the night before i’d assiduously avoided the news and yet somehow i didn’t fall asleep until late into the morning. it was as if i was channeling the world’s cumulative anxiety. i came to, feeling exhausted, and checked the news, and felt worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="5:1-5:373"&gt;it was an appropriately somber day: cold, foggy, near freezing. after we gathered our wits, we planned on visiting the brandenburg gate and the nearby memorials. on arrival, we saw a half dozen geriatric protestors holding a banner against russian war sanctions, and for “peace”, and a lone counter protestor with a ukrainian flag churned an organ grinder.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-euro-discourse" id="fnref-euro-discourse" data-footnote-ref&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="7:1-7:341"&gt;we wandered towards the holocaust memorials. it felt sobering, which of course is their purpose, though it’s not like i learned anything i didn’t know before. i had a ww2 phase&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-ww2-phase" id="fnref-ww2-phase" data-footnote-ref&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; in university, i’d visited these same monuments long ago. but this time on this day i was struck by the timelines presented in the memorial plaques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="9:1-9:432"&gt;it’s not like people got shipped to a camp from one day to the next, as soon as the reichstag burned down. there was a whole decade of ratcheting humiliation and persecution. prevented from leaving, forced to divest of your heritage and your life savings, separated from your family, and finally worked to death. at an industrial scale they squeezed every ounce of vitality and hope from you before extinguishing your flame forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="11:1-11:332"&gt;the last time i was here i didn’t have a family. the last time i was here i wasn’t queer yet, or at least i didn’t know it at the time. now i had an extra weight on my mind: is there anything worse than being separated from your children? people just like me were sent to these camps, too, a pink triangle pinned to their chest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="13:1-13:565"&gt;and i thought: they’re going to build new camps. first, they’ll come for the undocumented immigrants; people who are not quite like me, but whose spanish last names are similar to mine. then, they’ll come for the most annoying, the rowdiest leftists, the people willing to punch back and put their bodies on the line; people who have less to lose than i do, but whose politics are very similar to mine. and then, then they’ll come for people exactly like me, folks who live and love in freedom. and after that, the deluge, the free-for-all, the grab what you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="15:1-15:268"&gt;at the next memorial, i wandered along the concrete stelae, feeling their smooth surface. as i walked along the uneven ground they rose above me, towering, grey columns against a grey sky. they obviously resemble giant tombstones: who could you have been?, i wondered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="17:1-17:219"&gt;and i thought: you can be ground to dust, and the echoes of your ghost will be used by your grandchildren to justify new atrocities. the death of your babies will be used to explain why someone else’s babies must die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="19:1-19:327"&gt;silence equals death, but as i type this i feel weary of talking too much or too plainly about &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; genocide, the genocide that’s currently happening, for fear of retribution. in some quarters talking about it critically has been nearly criminalized. i’ve seen people get punished and blacklisted for speaking plain truths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="21:1-21:391"&gt;i’ve seen people i respected spew vile, reprehensible things, whether openly racist or just knowingly obfuscated. it’s sobering to know who – how many more – will see my humanity as conditional, too. is this something i’d be willing to lose a job over? it’s not my people, it’s not my fight, it’s far away, there’s hardly anything we can do anyways, i don’t need the attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="23:1-23:23"&gt;am i on a list already?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes" data-footnotes&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-euro-discourse"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="25:20-25:235"&gt;i squinted and tried to replay my understanding of european political discourse. i think they’re pro the evil dictator mainly because they are anti-north atlantic alliance? the geezers had an “anti-imperialist” vibe. &lt;a href="#fnref-euro-discourse" class="footnote-backref" data-footnote-backref aria-label="Back to content"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-ww2-phase"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="26:15-26:455"&gt;i took a course on international relations leading up to ww1, which was mostly 19th century history. i took a course on ww2, and read the textbook, and then i read the rise and fall of the third reich (shirer), and then i read a world at arms (weinberg). i had a vague memory of newscasts playing footage from the fall of the berlin wall, but i did not apprehend its meaning until i took a course on the cold war. then i read postwar (judt). &lt;a href="#fnref-ww2-phase" class="footnote-backref" data-footnote-backref aria-label="Back to content"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TCAF 2024 and "The Chromatic Fantasy"</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;h1 data-sourcepos="1:1-1:39"&gt;
&lt;a id="tcaf-2024-and-the-chromatic-fantasy" class="anchor" href="#tcaf-2024-and-the-chromatic-fantasy" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;TCAF 2024 and “The Chromatic Fantasy”&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="3:1-3:213"&gt;Due to childcare commitments, I had a tight window. As soon as my youngest snoozed, I hopped on the subway and found myself at the Toronto Reference Library for the 2024 edition of the Toronto Comic Arts Festival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="5:1-5:80"&gt;I had exactly 45 minutes, which was obviously not enough time.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-not-enough-time" id="fnref-not-enough-time" data-footnote-ref&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="7:1-7:518"&gt;I made peace with this fact,&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-money-not-time" id="fnref-money-not-time" data-footnote-ref&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and set out to try score a few cool books. I floated around the first floor, where the main indie publishers set up shop, and felt out the vibes.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-super-fan" id="fnref-super-fan" data-footnote-ref&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Right away I came across &lt;em&gt;Shubeik Lubeik&lt;/em&gt; by Deena Mohamed, which &lt;a href="https://riteshbabu.net/2024/01/05/comics-i-loved-in-2023/"&gt;I’d seen on a best-of 2023 list&lt;/a&gt; and had been meaning to purchase. Sitting right next to it was Mattie Lubchansky’s &lt;em&gt;Boys Weekend&lt;/em&gt;, and those were both obvious and immediate gets.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-gender" id="fnref-gender" data-footnote-ref&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="9:1-9:324"&gt;I buzzed around the Drawn and Quarterly table (&lt;em&gt;Are You Willing To Die For The Cause?&lt;/em&gt;), and at Pow Pow’s table I picked up &lt;em&gt;Vampire Cousins&lt;/em&gt;, why not, and I felt like I &lt;em&gt;ought&lt;/em&gt; to read &lt;em&gt;Toxic: A Tour of the Ecuadorian Amazon&lt;/em&gt;, and so I picked that up too. (Who knew that the University of Toronto Press also prints comics?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="11:1-11:73"&gt;By now I was running out of time, but I felt like I wanted one more book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="13:1-13:206"&gt;I toured the tables out along the windows, but none of their wares spoke to me, and I found myself back along the main drag. I wandered towards the exit, nervously looking around, when a book caught my eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="15:1-15:146"&gt;The pages were gilded, and sparkled. I flipped through it, and the art seemed to want to leap out of every page. The description at the back read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-sourcepos="17:1-17:530"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="17:2-17:530"&gt;Jules is a trans man trapped in his life as a nun. The devil that the convent guards against offers him a deal to escape: an illicit tryst and lifelong possession. Jules takes the deal, and begins his new life as a criminal who’s impervious to harm. He soon meets Casper, another trans man and a poetic thief, and together they steal, lie, and cheat their way through bewildering adventures, and develop feelings for each other along the way. But as Jules and Casper’s relationship deepens, so does the devil’s jealous grasp…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="19:1-19:46"&gt;and I thought: COOL, GOOD ENOUGH, LET’S DO IT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="21:1-21:148"&gt;I bought it and hurried home, arriving just before my two-and-a-half year old woke up, and we were due to go to grandma’s for mother’s day. Success!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="23:1-23:199"&gt;That book is &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://store.silversprocket.net/en-ca/products/the-chromatic-fantasy-by-h-a"&gt;The Chromatic Fantasy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and I want to tell you about it. It’s the reason why I am writing this blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-sourcepos="25:1-25:55"&gt;
&lt;a id="the-chromatic-fantasy-is-so-fucking-good-you-guys" class="anchor" href="#the-chromatic-fantasy-is-so-fucking-good-you-guys" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Chromatic Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; is so fucking good, you guys&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="27:1-27:53"&gt;I don’t know how to say this without overselling it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="29:1-29:332"&gt;I went into it with zero expectations, which imho is the best way to appreciate art, so from that perspective I have already ruined it. It’s also clear to me that a big part of its charm is precisely that it appeared serendipitously, right at the last moment, as if it was calling out to me, just like the devil in the story itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="31:1-31:92"&gt;You, dear reader, will not be able to enjoy it like I have enjoyed it, and I am sad for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="33:1-33:60"&gt;But what a story! Without any spoilers, the book deals with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul data-sourcepos="34:1-40:0"&gt;
&lt;li data-sourcepos="34:1-34:37"&gt;transitioning and navigating gender&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-sourcepos="35:1-35:32"&gt;abusive romantic relationships&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-sourcepos="36:1-36:32"&gt;abusive familial relationships&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-sourcepos="37:1-37:39"&gt;not fitting in, and suicidal ideation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-sourcepos="38:1-38:56"&gt;being an aimless scumbag in your early-to-mid-twenties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-sourcepos="39:1-40:0"&gt;and above all, falling in love and desperately wanting to live, and &lt;em&gt;be loved&lt;/em&gt; and to &lt;em&gt;be deserving of love&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="41:1-41:244"&gt;And it wraps all of this up in a one-shot, swashbuckling sword and sorcery adventure in a anachronistically medieval setting. The whole book is luscious, both sensual and luxuriating in detail, hardly any of which escape the author’s attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="43:1-43:190"&gt;Which makes sense, as I later found &lt;a href="https://www.comicsbeat.com/interview-h-a-on-the-chromatic-fantasys-technicolor-queer-realized/"&gt;this interview with the H.A., the author,&lt;/a&gt; where he says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-sourcepos="45:1-45:555"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="45:3-45:555"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;H.A.:&lt;/strong&gt; I was really stoked that it looked as good as I’d hoped it would. It was awesome to finally see it all come together. I really wanted the whole book, as an object, to feel like a complete maximalist work in itself. I didn’t want any page to feel underutilized. I’m really glad I was able to design the entire book cover and the title pages and everything. Silver Sprocket did a really good job with printing it and gave me a lot of freedom and I’m so glad they were able to help me make it as tacky and obnoxious as I wanted it to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="47:1-47:324"&gt;How fun is that? I think he did a great job. It’s fun, it’s sexy, the costumes and fashion and settings are gorgeous, and the characters are so well designed. It makes me think about being in my own mid-twenties, and getting high and spending too much time in a tumblr and wikipedia hole circa 2012, but like, in a good way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-sourcepos="49:1-49:25"&gt;
&lt;a id="a-note-on-being-queer" class="anchor" href="#a-note-on-being-queer" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;A note on being queer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="51:1-51:350"&gt;From the get-go, H.A. makes it clear that his mission is to make a goofy and campy romp featuring trans-men having fun. Just two dudes, having a good time, and being unabashedly queer. Yet here he does a funny thing: his characters don’t look like what I thought that they were going to look like, especially in a fantasy setting where anything goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="53:1-53:94"&gt;To quote &lt;a href="https://retrospring.net/@dirtcup_art/a/112069101918572008"&gt;from H.A.’s retrospring&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-sourcepos="55:1-55:176"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="55:3-55:176"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anonymous:&lt;/strong&gt; Ngl at first I thought Jules and Casper were lesbians and it was a surprise discovering they’re boys. Thank you for the way you convey their gender expression!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-sourcepos="57:1-57:177"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="57:3-57:177"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;H.A.&lt;/strong&gt;: my relationship w gender is complicated and I have a hard time naming it except to express it thru characters or by being myself and this is the best way I can do it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="60:1-60:229"&gt;Like, I myself, I identify as trans-femme. I think women are pretty great. I’ve gone to great lengths to try to be more like women. Going in, I was ready to be like, this won’t neccessarily speak to me directly, and that’s fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="62:1-62:204"&gt;But now that I’ve read the book, I’m like: if I &lt;em&gt;had to&lt;/em&gt; detransition? and be, like, a guy again (gross)? I would want my whole vibe to be like Casper’s in the comic. What a beautiful and chill way to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="64:1-64:60"&gt;Anyways, I’m going to buy three copies to give out as gifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes" data-footnotes&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-not-enough-time"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="66:21-66:318"&gt;To do TCAF properly, without rushing, you need at least three hours to properly wander the festival and take in all the sights and scenes. I really enjoy going to TCAF. I’ve been, gosh, &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; a half dozen times. I remember going in 2005, when it was held in the parking lot behind Honest Ed’s. &lt;a href="#fnref-not-enough-time" class="footnote-backref" data-footnote-backref aria-label="Back to content"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-money-not-time"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="67:21-67:214"&gt;In 2005, I had all the time in the world but I had to count my pennies and agonize over each and every purchase. As I approach middle age, I might lack time but I am at least blessed with money. &lt;a href="#fnref-money-not-time" class="footnote-backref" data-footnote-backref aria-label="Back to content"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-super-fan"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="68:15-70:532"&gt;I’m not a comics… super-fan. I love the medium; I think comics have a special power to capture the reader’s attention and take them away to another time and place. They provide a unique and arresting combination of visuals and text.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
But any given comic book has to speak to me, I don’t know. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The art has to “pop”. Half-tone manga leaves me cold. I like that photocopied zines exist more than I enjoy actually reading them. If I were an artist myself, I might enjoy leafing through sketchbooks – but I’m not, and so I don’t. In theory I feel like I should enjoy weird abstract experiments, but more often than not I just want to be charmed by a story and escape somewhere, or at least learn something new.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-comics-history" id="fnref-comics-history" data-footnote-ref&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Frankly, I have read one too many raw and overly honest autobiographical coming-of-age retellings. &lt;a href="#fnref-super-fan" class="footnote-backref" data-footnote-backref aria-label="Back to content"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-gender"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="72:12-72:523"&gt;Here, a brief pause. A couple years ago, when I was figuring out my gender and coming out, Mattie was a rare source of inspiration for being trans-femme non-binary. I remember being fascinated with their transition. I’m happy to report that &lt;em&gt;Boys Weekend&lt;/em&gt; is a fun romp, and I felt simultaneously like the protagonist, a trans-femme non-binary former-beardo, and that I was being roasted. I’ve always enjoyed TCAF, but gosh, now that I’m queer it’s taken on new depths. There were &lt;em&gt;so many of us&lt;/em&gt; milling around. &lt;a href="#fnref-gender" class="footnote-backref" data-footnote-backref aria-label="Back to content"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-comics-history"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="71:21-71:415"&gt;I grew up on brazillian translations of Spiderman and X-Men comics, several issues cropped and bound into little A5 booklets they sold in papelarias. Occasionally we would get Duck Tales, or Mafalda. In highschool, I read &lt;em&gt;Sandman&lt;/em&gt; and was blown away. One of my best friends’ cool older brother lent me his copy of Joe Sacco’s &lt;em&gt;Palestine&lt;/em&gt;, and every book Joe has made has felt like a revelation. &lt;a href="#fnref-comics-history" class="footnote-backref" data-footnote-backref aria-label="Back to content"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

    <title>You're not Facebook. Why use their tools?</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;h1 data-sourcepos="1:1-1:43"&gt;
&lt;a id="youre-not-facebook-why-use-their-tools" class="anchor" href="#youre-not-facebook-why-use-their-tools" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;You’re not Facebook. Why use their tools?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="3:1-3:215"&gt;I’ve seen folks expend remarkable amounts of effort to adopt Facebook tooling, for example GraphQL and React. Typically, the reasoning is that they’re Industry Best Practice™ for Solving These Particular Problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="5:1-5:242"&gt;I don’t have well-formed or particularly nuanced views on the One True And Right Way To Make Rich Client Web Applications. But as I approach middle age I think I’ve just enough experience to know when something is messier than it ought to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="7:1-7:200"&gt;I want to push back on this “Industry Best Practice” view. I fear that the honest reasoning is more like “Facebook has high prestige; if I try to be more like Facebook, my own prestige will increase”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-sourcepos="9:1-9:31"&gt;
&lt;a id="facebook-is-an-anti-pattern" class="anchor" href="#facebook-is-an-anti-pattern" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Facebook is an anti-pattern&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="11:1-11:207"&gt;Instead of thinking “well, Facebook does this, and Facebook is a rich and successful company – so it must be a good idea”, we should be more like “Facebook does this? – ah, &lt;strong&gt;it’s probably a bad idea&lt;/strong&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="13:1-13:104"&gt;I have come to believe that “whatever Facebook does is an anti-pattern” is a much more useful heuristic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="15:1-15:52"&gt;My reasoning goes like this: &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; are not Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="17:1-17:283"&gt;Very few companies are shaped like Facebook, and therefore decisions that make sense for Facebook probably don’t make sense for you. It’s ironic, tragic even, that so many people think that tools that make sense for Facebook will automatically make sense for their own organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="19:1-19:79"&gt;There are two ways in the vast majority of organizations are not like Facebook:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol data-sourcepos="20:1-22:0"&gt;
&lt;li data-sourcepos="20:1-20:112"&gt;Facebook is a very high traffic, very high margin advertising business with a quasi monopoly on its audience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-sourcepos="21:1-22:0"&gt;Nothing important happens on Facebook.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 data-sourcepos="23:1-23:42"&gt;
&lt;a id="1-facebook-is-big-and-flush-with-cash" class="anchor" href="#1-facebook-is-big-and-flush-with-cash" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;1. Facebook is big, and flush with cash&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="25:1-25:378"&gt;Fact 1 means that &lt;strong&gt;Facebook has an unusual amount of resources at its disposal&lt;/strong&gt;. They can afford to pay developers obscene salaries to compensate for the moral injury of working at Facebook. And those developers can toil away at problems that are either irrelevant or out-of-scope for the vast majority of organizations that lack either their scale or their access to capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="27:1-27:389"&gt;Consider GraphQL. As a domain specific language for querying graph shaped data, it has an admirable goal. I’m sure it really is a remarkable tool for rich client developers to iterate on new designs without having to negotiate new APIs with their backend counterparts. As a single, common interface for querying data, data which is often stored in different silos, it sure seems promising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="29:1-29:367"&gt;But in practice… well, those silos are real, they exist for (good and bad) reasons. If your data access spans several teams’ areas of responsibility, then it’s fiendishly easy to end up with &lt;em&gt;stupendously slow &amp;amp; expensive queries&lt;/em&gt;. If ownership is diffuse, then no one’s worrying about the performance of this one retrieval pattern and you get weird scaling issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="31:1-31:75"&gt;If you’re joining data across mysql clusters, someone has to pay the piper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="33:1-33:384"&gt;Put another way: a GraphQL only makes sense if you have &lt;em&gt;a whole team dedicated&lt;/em&gt; to making it not suck. To have a GraphQL API at scale is to have a GraphQL API platform team whose sole job is to fuss over it and keep it ticking. The vast majority of organizations aren’t big enough, nor high margin enough, to justify spending millions of dollars a year optimizing their API platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="35:1-35:130"&gt;In most organizations, it probably really is easier to just ask the team responsible to open up an endpoint – or do it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="37:1-37:233"&gt;(In this sense, GraphQL to me smells almost like an attempt to deal with Facebook’s org chart: the dedicated GraphQL platform team bears the coordination costs, instead of having dozens of teams duking it out with each other ad hoc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-sourcepos="40:1-40:30"&gt;
&lt;a id="2-facebok-is-not-important" class="anchor" href="#2-facebok-is-not-important" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;2. Facebok is not important&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="42:1-42:158"&gt;Which leads us into Fact 2: &lt;strong&gt;nobody cares if Facebook has downtime&lt;/strong&gt;. Nobody’s day is ruined because Facebook had ten or thirty or sixty minutes of downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="44:1-44:373"&gt;Time spent on Facebook competes with other leisure activities. If the hate speech and cat pictures website doesn’t work right now, you’ll just try again later, whatever. You can just watch tv, read a book, or go for a walk instead. When Facebook goes down, it’s really not a big deal in the grand scheme of things. Most people will never notice that it happened.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-downtime" id="fnref-downtime" data-footnote-ref&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="46:1-46:361"&gt;By contrast, if my current employer has an availability incident, the entire internet explodes into paroxysms of rage because they can’t get their work done. It’s not an exageration to say that deliveries might not get made, factories might sit idle, etc, because GitHub is a &lt;em&gt;productive tool&lt;/em&gt;. There are things you can only accomplish because this tool exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-sourcepos="48:1-48:33"&gt;
&lt;a id="your-tools-make-what-you-ship" class="anchor" href="#your-tools-make-what-you-ship" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Your tools make what you ship&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="50:1-50:136"&gt;This distinction matters because these incentives towards availability percolate throughout your entire stack &amp;amp; architectural decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="52:1-52:328"&gt;If your React stack makes deployment more brittle, and you’ve added multiple round trips of latency, and a widget fails to load for whatever reason, and the whole thing contrives to swallow errors – Facebook has teams of people slaving away optimizing all of these steps, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; they have a way higher tolerance for messing up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="54:1-54:74"&gt;Move fast and break things!, is easy when &lt;em&gt;nobody cares that it’s broken&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="57:1-57:294"&gt;My employer promises its users three nines of uptime. I giggled at the idea of Facebook offering a service level agreement, and when I googled it in fact they explicitly say “lol what SLA? sometimes when we deploy the API will go down for 5 minutes”.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-whatsapp-sla" id="fnref-whatsapp-sla" data-footnote-ref&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 5 minutes of downtime! Lmao.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="59:1-59:115"&gt;I live in a different world. Where I work, I work on real things that matter. And so do most programmers out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-sourcepos="61:1-61:17"&gt;
&lt;a id="in-conclusion" class="anchor" href="#in-conclusion" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;In conclusion,&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="63:1-63:139"&gt;Facebook should be considered harmful. Facebook’s devrel marketing is designed to ease their hiring pipeline and destroy their competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="65:1-65:29"&gt;Govern yourself accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes" data-footnotes&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-downtime"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="70:14-70:331"&gt;Of course if Facebook goes down… &lt;em&gt;Facebook&lt;/em&gt; will be sad, cos Facebook will lose money. I suppose their customers (the advertisers) will be sad because their future sales trajectory will be impacted, but I bet even they don’t get that worked up about it. Ads that didn’t get displayed today can be displayed tomorrow. &lt;a href="#fnref-downtime" class="footnote-backref" data-footnote-backref aria-label="Back to content"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-whatsapp-sla"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="68:18-68:309"&gt;“When we update the API, you may experience up to 5 minutes of downtime.” / “We do not currently offer commercially available product service level agreements for uptime and/or latency.” &lt;a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/support/#faq_775539867197306"&gt;https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/support/#faq_775539867197306&lt;/a&gt;, accessed 2024-04-22 &lt;a href="#fnref-whatsapp-sla" class="footnote-backref" data-footnote-backref aria-label="Back to content"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>hyperobjects</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;h1 data-sourcepos="1:1-1:14"&gt;
&lt;a id="hyperobjects" class="anchor" href="#hyperobjects" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;hyperobjects&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="3:1-3:251"&gt;i recently had to grapple with how my work’s APIs handled authorization. our team wanted to do something slightly weird, and given my talents and knowledge of where the bodies are buried it fell to me to figure out how to do it safely &amp;amp; securely, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="5:1-5:300"&gt;now, the beating heart of GitHub is a sprawling, sixteen-year-old ruby on rails app so that is easier said than done,&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-rails" id="fnref-rails" data-footnote-ref&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but in theory who is allowed to read or write to this particular resource? ought to be a straight forward question. the system answers this literally millions of times a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="7:1-7:362"&gt;patiently reading code and docs has historically served me quite well, so i sat down and started reading. there was a lot of code and docs, though, and i spent weeks, and weeks, &lt;em&gt;and weeks&lt;/em&gt; on this question. eventually, i thought i had resolved it to my satisfaction, and wrote it up in a narrative i presented to my team. and everyone agreed that it made sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="9:1-9:34"&gt;but then a curious thing happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="11:1-11:256"&gt;i asked a former teammate of mine, an expert in this system, for a sanity check, and she pointed out that i had missed an important detail. the approach i had outlined in my doc was &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; correct, which is another way of saying that it could never work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="13:1-13:24"&gt;i went back to the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="15:1-15:426"&gt;and now every time i looked at some corner case, i seemed to find new quirks. someone would ask a perfectly sensible question that iluminated a corner of my ignorance. i struggled to explain what some of our automated tests &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be doing, and i kept finding new unexpected behaviour, lurking in a different part of the codebase i had either not read – or had read many times before, but had yet been able to internalize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="17:1-17:410"&gt;i eventually realized, far too late, that the full set of behaviour that describes how the app handles authorization – every nook and cranny, in its majestic entirety – was simply too large to fit in my head all at once. or more likely, &lt;em&gt;anyone’s&lt;/em&gt; head. after over a decade of effort, rearchitecting for scale, handling new-use cases,&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-invariants" id="fnref-invariants" data-footnote-ref&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; etc, etc, the system had simply accreted too many details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="19:1-19:109"&gt;it has become a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/timothy-morton-hyperobjects-all-the-way-down/"&gt;hyperobject&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-sourcepos="21:1-21:689"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="21:2-21:689"&gt;Examples of hyperobjects include: black holes, oil spills, all plastic ever manufactured, capitalism, tectonic plates, and the solar system. Hyperobjects are often ancient or destined to be, like the sum total of Styrofoam and plutonium we have littered across the Earth over the past century, which will remain for millennia. A human being may see &lt;em&gt;evidence&lt;/em&gt; of hyperobjects—pollution here, a hurricane there—but try gazing off into the distance to see the &lt;em&gt;totality&lt;/em&gt; of them, or to the very &lt;em&gt;end&lt;/em&gt; of them, and they disappear into a vanishing point. Hyperobjects, as Morton says, emerge only in fragments and patches that do not always seem to connect up from our view on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 data-sourcepos="23:1-23:13"&gt;
&lt;a id="well-duh" class="anchor" href="#well-duh" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;well, duh?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="25:1-25:42"&gt;in one sense, this observation is trivial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="27:1-27:300"&gt;our ruby on rails monolith alone, nevermind the dozens of services that connect to it, has seen hundreds and hundreds of engineers pour a lot of code into it. it is immediately apparent to all who clone the repository that the app as a whole is too vast and enormous for any one person to comprehend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="29:1-29:106"&gt;however, i had yet to grasp that even &lt;strong&gt;important subsets&lt;/strong&gt; of the app could also be beyond comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr data-sourcepos="31:1-32:0"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="33:1-33:221"&gt;around the same time, i came across &lt;a href="https://backofmind.substack.com/p/songs-my-portfolio-manager-taught-4fe"&gt;this entry in Dan Davies’ newsletter&lt;/a&gt;, and here i will just quote the relevant passage in full (emphasis mine):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-sourcepos="35:1-35:101"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="35:2-35:101"&gt;Once upon a time, in the early to mid stages of the Global Financial Crisis, a client said to me …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-sourcepos="37:1-37:614"&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-sourcepos="37:2-37:614"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="37:7-37:614"&gt;“Danny, since this thing began, there have been two types of analysts. Some people, like yourself, have been trying to develop their understanding of an incredibly complicated system, under huge pressure, absorbing vast amounts of technical detail in a short time, and doing a fairly good job of it. Others have just been mindless bomb-throwers, trying to attract attention to themselves with ill-informed displays of competitive panic. I decided early in this crisis that I was going to listen to the second type of analyst – and they have turned out, systematically, to be much closer to being right”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-sourcepos="39:1-39:475"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="39:2-39:475"&gt;He was correct; I changed my approach as a result and consequently, I think, did a much better job of understanding the Eurocrisis. &lt;strong&gt;There’s a very great danger in believing that either a) the whole problem is of a size that you can fit in your head, so understanding it is just a matter of working hard enough, or that b) the relationship between the amount of detail you know and your understanding of the system is positive and monotonic.&lt;/strong&gt; This is often not the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="41:1-41:175"&gt;i’m still meditating on the meaning of this quote. i experienced it as a bit of a profound insight. i’ve been meaning to track down Dan’s email so i can ask him more about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-sourcepos="43:1-43:12"&gt;
&lt;a id="now-what" class="anchor" href="#now-what" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;now what?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="45:1-45:288"&gt;at any rate, my work (my life) is filled with hyperobjects. i have to grapple with them all the time. not coincidentally, Dan is &lt;a href="https://profilebooks.com/work/the-unaccountability-machine/"&gt;working on a book on cybernetics&lt;/a&gt;, and it makes me think a lot about the ol’ Stafford Beer quote,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-sourcepos="47:1-47:56"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="47:3-47:56"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The purpose of a system is what it does.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-posiwid" id="fnref-posiwid" data-footnote-ref&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="49:1-49:254"&gt;we can’t understand the whole system. nobody can take in every part and absorb every detail. and the intentions of any individual contributor are irrelevant. the only thing we can do is try to step outside and observe the actions it takes upon the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="51:1-51:113"&gt;i’m probably mixing metaphors. but! with the benefit of hindsight, how should i have tackled my research problem?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="53:1-53:265"&gt;i should’ve ignored all of the code &amp;amp; first attacked the test suite. work backwards from those weird tests i struggled with. those tests describe the behaviour we actually see, at a high enough level to be useful. how it works under the hood kind of doesn’t matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="55:1-55:50"&gt;when wrestling a hyperobject, you kind of have to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul data-sourcepos="56:1-60:0"&gt;
&lt;li data-sourcepos="56:1-56:9"&gt;squint,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-sourcepos="57:1-57:21"&gt;suss out the vibes,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-sourcepos="58:1-58:49"&gt;don’t try to take it all in, because you can’t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-sourcepos="59:1-60:0"&gt;instead, measure the end result you can see; observe the outcomes, and use your intuition. what is the system trying to &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes" data-footnotes&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-rails"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="65:11-65:133"&gt;not, mind you, because it’s a rails app; a lot of people struggle with that fact, for some reason, but i’m not one of them. &lt;a href="#fnref-rails" class="footnote-backref" data-footnote-backref aria-label="Back to content"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-invariants"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="61:16-61:263"&gt;the other day i came across Lorin’s post “&lt;a href="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/2024/03/26/the-problem-with-invariants-is-that-they-change-over-time/"&gt;the problem with invariants is that they change over time&lt;/a&gt;” and its simple truth still makes me giggle. &lt;a href="#fnref-invariants" class="footnote-backref" data-footnote-backref aria-label="Back to content"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-posiwid"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="63:13-63:97"&gt;cf &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_purpose_of_a_system_is_what_it_does"&gt;wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="#fnref-posiwid" class="footnote-backref" data-footnote-backref aria-label="Back to content"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>I've planted a garden 👩‍🌾🪴🪻</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p data-sourcepos="1:1-1:133"&gt;I’m adding a &lt;a href="/garden.html"&gt;garden section&lt;/a&gt; to this website,&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-garden" id="fnref-garden" data-footnote-ref&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; in the hope that I am able to make something interesting bloom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="3:1-3:176"&gt;I’ve been enjoying Lu’s &lt;a href="https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/"&gt;wikiblogarden&lt;/a&gt;, and been feeling inspired by the idea of &lt;a href="https://www.tadiweb.com/"&gt;keeping a slippy mindset&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="5:1-5:576"&gt;For a long time I have been consumed with &lt;em&gt;hot takes&lt;/em&gt; and ideas that are too long to fit in a social media post, but not fleshed out enough to be a Full Thought Bearing The Full Weight of my Endorsement. That might sound like a weirdly high bar for my own rinky dink little personal website – but once I started publishing &lt;a href="/2021/british-columbia-more-yimby-california.html"&gt;semi-novel housing research&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="/2018/rent-control-great-security-of-tenure.html"&gt;exhaustively footnoted treatises on rent control&lt;/a&gt;, it felt awkward to put out half-baked ideas in the same “area”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="7:1-7:56"&gt;And so those ideas languished, with nowhere to put them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="9:1-9:227"&gt;A separate section is an attempt to break that feeling of awkwardness. I’d like to experiment with writing &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; silly and semi-serious ideas, in the hopes that those ideas either grow or, together, form an interesting corpus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes" data-footnotes&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-garden"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="11:12-11:121"&gt;cf &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history"&gt;A Brief History &amp;amp; Ethos of the Digital Garden&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, Appleton 2020 &lt;a href="#fnref-garden" class="footnote-backref" data-footnote-backref aria-label="Back to content"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Good News: We Can Fix Traffic Safety!</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;figure id="fref:fig1"&gt;
&lt;a href="/2021/good-news-we-can-fix-traffic-safety/files/conversion-st-paul.png"&gt;&lt;img src="/2021/good-news-we-can-fix-traffic-safety/files/conversion-st-paul.png" title="The Conversion of Saint Paul by Palma il Giovane, 1595." style="max-width:100%;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The Conversion of Saint Paul&lt;/i&gt; by Palma il Giovane, 1595.
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="8:1-8:147"&gt;We suffer from many hard collective action problems whose solution requires coordination across local, regional, national and international actors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="10:1-10:64"&gt;For example, there is no individual person I can yell at to fix:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul data-sourcepos="12:1-16:0"&gt;
&lt;li data-sourcepos="12:1-12:16"&gt;climate change&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-sourcepos="13:1-13:28"&gt;income &amp;amp; wealth inequality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-sourcepos="14:1-14:23"&gt;daylight savings time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-sourcepos="15:1-16:0"&gt;to say nothing of public transit, affordable housing, police brutality, truth and reconciliation, and so on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="17:1-17:241"&gt;No individual elected representative of mine can take a single vote, on a singular legislative item, that will meaningfully address any of these problems in one fell swoop. Life is hard. Working on these problems is many lifetimes of effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="19:1-19:73"&gt;That said, I have &lt;strong&gt;extremely good news&lt;/strong&gt; I would like to share with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="21:1-21:369"&gt;There is &lt;strong&gt;one problem&lt;/strong&gt; that we suffer from, a problem that stares us in the face every day. A problem that kills people all the time. A problem that horrifically maims innocent children on a near-daily basis. And, it is a problem which, in fact, an individual elected representative of mine could meaningfully address, in a single vote on a singular legislative item.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="23:1-23:35"&gt;That problem is &lt;strong&gt;traffic safety&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="25:1-25:347"&gt;Unlike housing or wealth inequality or climate change, traffic safety is actually almost entirely in control of my local municipality. My city councillor doesn’t have jurisdiction over air pollution, or carbon taxes, or whether we roll back the clocks. But the city of Toronto does have jurisdiction over how my local roads are designed and built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="27:1-27:66"&gt;A single dinner party’s worth of people could, with a single vote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul data-sourcepos="28:1-31:0"&gt;
&lt;li data-sourcepos="28:1-28:163"&gt;create a new, default, standard for road and street design which prioritizes pedestrian safety, and which is applied to all new future road works across the city&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-sourcepos="29:1-29:143"&gt;immediately begin adding new bike lanes, reducing road widths, adding speed bumps, and even close roads off to cars altogether where possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-sourcepos="30:1-31:0"&gt;dramatically make new and substantial progress and change the city for the better, for decades to come.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="32:1-32:319"&gt;It would barely cost any money up front, and it would save tons of money in the long run. It would save scores of lives, whether killed outright or forever altered by terrible injuries. It would reduce pollution. It would improve the quality of our lives. It would make a small dent towards ameliorating climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="34:1-34:194"&gt;So, why can’t we make progress on that front? What could we change? What if we took this challenge seriously? City council recently got cut down to 26 people. You only need 14 people to say yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="36:1-36:221"&gt;I think the reason is we’ve forgotten how to ask. I think we’ve forgotten how to make some noise. I think we’ve forgotten how to get real fucking inconvenient. I think we’ve forgotten how to imagine the future we deserve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="38:1-38:191"&gt;I think if we talk to our neighbours, if we get a little organized, if we start blocking streets during rush hour, if we make a big fucking fuss about it, I think we could make some progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="40:1-40:172"&gt;All in all, I feel optimistic. This is &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; news. There is a terrible problem that you can help improve dramatically if you yell at a single person, over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="42:1-42:43"&gt;In this day and age, how wonderful is that?&lt;/p&gt;</content>
