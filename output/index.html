    <p>By trade, I tell computers what to do. I make apps, I build products, I throw events. I think about people, urbanism, housing, the internet, and living a good life. I live in Toronto, and I prefer they/them pronouns.</p>

    <a href="https://appcanary.com" class="project"><img class="logo" title="Appcanary" src="img/appcanary.logo.png" /></a>
    <p>From 2015 to late 2017, I was a cofounder of <a href="https://appcanary.com">Appcanary</a>. We tracked security vulnerabilities in open source code and notified our customers when they had to take action.</p>
    <p>We got into Y Combinator, we raised money, we built a product, we built a small team, we got customers, we wrote content marketing and published a podcast, we monitored hundreds of servers and thousands of apps. Alas, the market wasn't quite what we thought it was, and we ended up being acquired by GitHub.</p>

    <p>It was an interesting time! You can find out more via our <a href="http://blog.appcanary.com"> company blog</a>.</p>


    <h2 style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace; font-weight: normal;" class="project xvzf"><a href="http://xvzf.io">xvzf</a></h2>
    <p>Established in 2014, with a few co-conspirators, I organize and throw a regularly occurring storytelling night for Toronto tech workers. We produce a podcast, and a whole bunch of people show up. You should <a href="http://xvzf.io">check it out</a>.</p>

    <img class="logo project" src="img/stateio.logo.png" />
    <p>Until early 2015, I was a cofounder of <a href="http://state.io">State Machinery</a>, a security and development consultancy. We opened for business in November, 2012. We performed security audits, penetration tests, built mvps and advised teams on how to improve their software practice.</p>

    <h2 class="project">Gemcanary</h2>
    <p>
    In February 2013, we built <a href="https://gemcanary.com">Gemcanary</a>, a tool for monitoring known security disclosures in Rails/Bundler enabled applications on Github. I wrote a little bit more about it <a href="http://finite.state.io/blog/2013/03/08/making-gemcanary/">on the State Machinery blog</a>. It eventually led to <a href="https://www.appcanary.com">Appcanary</a>.

    <h2 class="project">Audiogram</h2>
    <p>
    Back in January 2012, I created an app for an dance party art installation. I combined the instagram api with some javascript and it was <a href="2013/instagram-fun-profit.html">a lot of fun</a>.
    </p>

    <h2 class="project">NYTimes Timelapse</h2>
    <p>
    In July 2011, I put together an <a href="2011/nytimes-timelapse.html">eight month time lapse</a> of the front page of the nytimes.com. I wrote a <a href="2011/howto-timelapse-nytimes.html">time lapse tutorial</a>, and I also happened to capture <a href="2011/bbc-timelapse.html">the front page of the bbc</a>. It got a lot of attention, and it was pretty neat.
    </p>

    <h2 class="project">Undergraduate thesis</h2>
    <p>
    In lieu of course work, prior to graduating I wrote an undergraduate thesis on <a href="2011/thoughts-on-building-a-feed-reader.html">applying a naïve bayesian classifier to rss feeds</a>.
