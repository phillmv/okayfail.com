    <p data-sourcepos="1:1-1:292">Back in December 2011, I was approached by <a href="http://mwjoffe.tumblr.com/">Michael Joffe</a> to make something happen for the early 2012 installment of his <a href="http://www.thegridto.com/life/society/the-nocturne-back-in-the-new-york-groove/">dance party art things</a>, this one being called “Oui Paris”.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="3:1-3:164">So, I stuck together some bits of ruby and javascript and made “audiogram”, an instagram feed that updates in real time, and Michael threw a dance party around it.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="5:1-5:127">The folks at the <a href="http://brocktoncollective.com/">Brockton Collective</a> were awesome and created a timelapse of the whole thing:</p>
<iframe width="480" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/QKBF3a6bkbw?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p data-sourcepos="9:1-9:177">A couple of times I had to <a href="http://instagram.com/p/lV_V7/">drunkenly climb a ladder</a> and troubleshoot it. (Here is more proof that <a href="http://instagram.com/p/lUq-X/">I was there</a>).</p>
<p data-sourcepos="11:1-11:251">Michael longed for something deeply interactive that would directly engage with the crowd. I’d always wanted an excuse to play with the instagram api and the rest was covered in <a href="http://www.nowtoronto.com/music/story.cfm?content=184963">NOW Magazine</a>:</p>
<blockquote data-sourcepos="13:1-13:405">
<p data-sourcepos="13:2-13:405">In order to do so, the organizers have implemented an interactive element that they’ve deemed “the world’s first Instagram music visualizer”. With the help of developer Phillip Mendonça-Vieira, they’ve created a display wall that will project partygoer’s pictures in real time, in the ersatz nostalgic haze of the Instagram photo app. All you need to participate is a smart phone<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="instagram-fun-profit.html#fn-yayinsta" id="fnref-yayinsta" data-footnote-ref>1</a></sup>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote data-sourcepos="15:1-15:296">
<p data-sourcepos="15:2-15:296">“Instagram has become a huge part of sharing life experiences… and in a way it tells much more of a story than a status update,” Joffe explains. “So with this party we wanted to do an experiment wherein a tool that is used to share experiences becomes the reason for the event itself.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p data-sourcepos="17:1-17:189">The event was a success; apparently something like 400 people<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="instagram-fun-profit.html#fn-instatruefact" id="fnref-instatruefact" data-footnote-ref>2</a></sup> showed up on a cold January night. The whole thing ended up being one of the coolest things I’ve done to date.</p>

<p data-sourcepos="23:1-23:62">I’m glad you asked. This video will give you the general idea:</p>

<p data-sourcepos="27:1-27:228">The reason I am writing about this now, in 2013, is because I never got around to making the above recording until a few months ago. I don’t understand why, or what overcame me, it really wasn’t that much work<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="instagram-fun-profit.html#fn-instaarcheology" id="fnref-instaarcheology" data-footnote-ref>3</a></sup>.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="29:1-29:361">Some people really took a liking to it, and the app has since been used in a <a href="http://throneofjs.com/parties/#parties">conference party</a>, a corporate holiday party, a wedding, a <a href="http://lookingforgold.blogspot.ca/2012/12/long-winter-three.html">winter music festival series</a>, and a sexy aids fundraising dance party<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="instagram-fun-profit.html#fn-instanopantsnoproblem" id="fnref-instanopantsnoproblem" data-footnote-ref>4</a></sup>.</p>

<p data-sourcepos="33:1-33:306">I wrote a little sinatra thing that spat out new instagram photos when asked. I put down a layer of <a href="http://masonry.desandro.com/">masonry</a> and wrapped it together with <a href="http://jmpressjs.github.io/jmpress.js/">jmpress.js</a>. It works surprisingly well: new photos show up within five seconds of being posted.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="35:1-35:275">The waterfall effect was achieved by prepending new instagram thumbnails in a div taller than the screen; masonry does the rest. I also remove elements a couple rows below the fold as a crude form of garbage collection. Without it, Chrome quickly starts to run out of memory.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="37:1-37:318">I was reticent to accept Michael’s invitation. I wasn’t sure if I could put together something that was cool enough<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="instagram-fun-profit.html#fn-instasob" id="fnref-instasob" data-footnote-ref>5</a></sup> and as a result it only really came together the week before the party date. Overall, I spent about five nights poking at it and one long evening and an afternoon frantically making it work.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="39:1-39:325">In the process I wrote some of the most terrible javascript ever committed to disk. I’ve since rewritten all the ruby a couple of times over, but that javascript remains inscrutable because I really don’t want to touch it. That javascript is why I haven’t linked to the github page. I’ve gotten a lot better at it since then.</p>

<p data-sourcepos="43:1-43:120">Telling the bouncer to let your friends <a href="http://instagram.com/p/lV7hv/">skip a huge line</a> feels pretty cool<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="instagram-fun-profit.html#fn-instalol" id="fnref-instalol" data-footnote-ref>6</a></sup>.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="45:1-45:205">I think to this day, event and location apps are underexplored. Something to facilitate documentation and increase serendipity. I think my phone could someday output significantly more whimsy into my life.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="47:1-47:173">The barrier to making something neat can be surprisingly low; the important thing is to play with it and see what you can make. I’ve been terrible at following this advice.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="49:1-49:88"><strong>tl;dr</strong> if someone asks you to write software for a dance party, say yes.</p>

<p data-sourcepos="51:14-51:235">It was the beginning of 2012; smart phones were common but not yet ubiquitous and instagram had only recently become a thing and it was cool and exciting and and no one thought it was going to be worth one billion dollars. <a href="instagram-fun-profit.html#fnref-yayinsta" class="footnote-backref" data-footnote-backref aria-label="Back to content">↩</a></p>

<p data-sourcepos="55:21-55:412">Oh, and the <code>#ouiparis</code> photos that pop up are obviously not from the dance party. In the preceeding year and a half, other people have begun to use <code>#ouiparis</code>. I love this kind of stuff, unique and obscure events buried away in tags. I feel there is one great short sci fi story in me where a crucial bit of plot stems around a 14 month old foursquare checkin someone made at a house party. <a href="instagram-fun-profit.html#fnref-instaarcheology" class="footnote-backref" data-footnote-backref aria-label="Back to content">↩</a></p>
