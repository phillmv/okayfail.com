<p data-sourcepos="3:1-3:103">One thing that comes up a lot in housing literature is the idea that “housing is highly heterogeneous”.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="5:1-5:451">This is another way of saying that no two homes are exactly the same: every dwelling varies in its exact location, size, amenities, building materials, etc, and so do the preferences and needs of its inhabitants. A young couple starting a family may highly value being near to a daycare, while others might place a higher premium on sunlight and being close to work. This makes matching households to appropriate housing challenging, to say the least.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="7:1-7:187">On reflection, it occurs to me that one under-considered notion in the online housing discourse is that housing <em>markets</em>, zoomed out to the regional level, are also highly heterogeneous.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="9:1-9:317">Consider the ways in which metropolitan areas vary. Almost by definition, every city has a unique location and geography with a unique set of advantages and disadvantages. Every city varies in its precise climate, terrain, natural resources, so on which constrain or influence its local building density and typology.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="11:1-11:338">The people are also different. Different localities have different norms, expectations and cultures. Different economies lead to differences in financing, access to capital and population growth. Different jurisdictions will differ in the precise way they are governed, and which powers accrue to which level of government will also vary.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="13:1-13:144">This might be a little trite, or obvious. But to me, this signals that we have to be more careful in the way we compare different jurisdictions.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="15:1-15:515">For example, consider rent control policies. Different countries regulate rent prices in different ways. In some countries, rents may be regulated at the national level. In Canada, that power is a provincial concern, and in many states in America it is left to the discretion of individual cities. This means that “rent control” in different regions refers to very different mixes of economic policy and tenant rights,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="housing-markets-heterogenous-filtering-toronto.html#fn-rent-control" id="fnref-rent-control" data-footnote-ref>1</a></sup> and therefore meaningful comparisons have to be careful about these distinctions.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="17:1-17:373">Another pet peeve of mine is the rhetorical use of Tokyo. Tokyo housing prices have remained affordable, we’re told, because of their comparatively libertarian approach to local land use regulations.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="housing-markets-heterogenous-filtering-toronto.html#fn-ft-2016" id="fnref-ft-2016" data-footnote-ref>2</a></sup> Codified at the national level, one’s ability to develop land does not face the many local veto points and bottlenecks that people have in Anglo-Western countries.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="19:1-20:97">Yet, the Japanese also have a radically different cultural attitude towards building depreciation. By Western standards, they are incredibly unceremonious about knocking down old buildings: the average demolished home is only about thirty years old.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="housing-markets-heterogenous-filtering-toronto.html#fn-japantimes-2014" id="fnref-japantimes-2014" data-footnote-ref>3</a></sup><br>
When buying a house, it is apparently common to simply tear the whole thing down and start fresh.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="22:1-22:427">This attitude makes sense if you consider that Japan is prone to earthquakes — and routinely updates its building codes — as well as the extent to which Japanese cities were destroyed during World War 2.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="housing-markets-heterogenous-filtering-toronto.html#fn-cnn-2017" id="fnref-cnn-2017" data-footnote-ref>4</a></sup> They also have different growth rates, a rapidly aging population, a massive housing price bubble that collapsed in the ’90s,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="housing-markets-heterogenous-filtering-toronto.html#fn-japanpropertycentral-2018" id="fnref-japanpropertycentral-2018" data-footnote-ref>5</a></sup> and a far more aggressive mass transit policy.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="24:1-24:121">This isn’t to say that the comparison is <em>invalid</em>. Just that we should be careful and thoughtful about these subtleties.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="26:1-26:42">Finally, consider the case of “filtering”.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="28:1-28:260">Filtering is the idea that as a dwelling ages and depreciates its value decreases — and as wealthier residents will choose to spend their higher incomes on nicer, newer accomodations — that dwelling will become affordable to lower income residents.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="30:1-30:543">Filtering is appealing on both ideological and practical grounds. It confirm’s one’s faith in the free market while also rendering a simple solution to housing unaffordability: build more housing, <em>any kind of housing</em>! As new housing is built and people move in, they free up housing stock lower in the “housing ladder” in a harmonious property chain. And though new housing is almost always designed for and marketed to the highest income brackets, over time that housing will also depreciate and “filter down” as it becomes more affordable.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="32:1-32:409">Filtering happens. Studies have documented it, and walking through Toronto it’s not hard to find. Witness the Annex, Cabbagetown and Parkdale’s “dirty mansions”: large single family dwellings, many of them built one hundred years ago or more, that have since been subdivided into small apartments buildings or rooming houses and are today significant sources of affordable, low-income housing.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="housing-markets-heterogenous-filtering-toronto.html#fn-micallef-2017" id="fnref-micallef-2017" data-footnote-ref>6</a></sup></p>
<p data-sourcepos="34:1-34:320">Filtering has problems, though. The most obvious is that significant depreciation takes decades, which is cold comfort to those who are under-housed today. Also, “depreciated” can be a polite word for “poorly maintained” or “falling apart”, and it’s awkward to say that low-income folks only deserve substandard housing.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="36:1-36:489">More importantly, however, is that in order for filtering to occur we need specific conditions that <em>no longer exist</em>. In a study commissioned by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation and published in 2004, Skaburski and Meligrana contrasted results from the 1981 and 1996 census. They concluded that, in growing cities, rents and prices in old buildings were actually <em>increasing</em> — and that filtering cannot be counted on to ease the housing cost burden of low-income people.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="38:1-38:487">The reasoning is pretty straightforward: the subdivided dirty mansion was a product of its time. Consider Parkdale. At the turn of the twentieth century, it was a desirable streetcar suburb with large lots, tree lined streets and easy recreational access to the lake. Then came the Great Depression, which prompted many families to subdivide their homes in order to take on boarders. By the 1950s, the area was labeled a slum and with the post-war boom came the push for suburbanization.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="40:1-40:495">Suburbanization was enabled by several policies acting in tandem. Worried about the housing shortage, the CMHC first began giving out loans to developers, then expanded middle class access to credit via its mortgage insurance program — which until 1966 could only be used to finance the purchase of new homes. Meanwhile, access to these new suburbs was made possible by highway expansion projects, like the new Gardiner Expressway which soon cut off Parkdale residents’ access to the lake.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="42:1-42:458">It is in this context that filtering occurred: a massive expansion of brand new, prestigious, subsidized suburban housing that was easier to finance than undesirable, old, rotting, fifty year old subdivided mansions. By the 1980s and 1990s, the demographic trend behind the suburban exodus began to reverse, mortgage financing was easier to obtain, and downtown living became desirable again — and those dirty old mansions got gentrified and renovated.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="44:1-44:509">Described more technically, consider that the capital cost of ownership housing consists of the land value plus the value of the building constructed atop the land. In order for the home to become cheaper, the building must age and lose value — but the land must also not <em>increase</em> in value. Land doesn’t depreciate; it only becomes more or less desirable. And until recently Parkdale was undesirable, first as the economy cratered and then as the suburban boom pushed all the growth away from Toronto.</p>
