    <p data-sourcepos="1:1-1:129"><strong>HOST:</strong> To talk about the ongoing labour dispute, we’ve reached Mr. CEO. Mr CEO, why are we about to see service disruptions?</p>
<p data-sourcepos="3:1-3:291"><strong>CEO:</strong> Well, we’ve been at the bargaining table for months, and we’ve made some proposals we think are fair. Seeing as the other side won’t budge, and their membership voted to enable a strike, we’ve been left with no choice but to preemptively break the union by locking them out.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="5:1-5:39"><strong>HOST:</strong> What are the issues at stake?</p>
<p data-sourcepos="7:1-7:258"><strong>CEO:</strong> As you can plainly see from my fairly disingenuous presentation of the numbers, we’re just about on the verge of bankruptcy — as far as salaries and pensions are concerned. We’ve just don’t have any more money, for salaries and pensions.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="9:1-9:167"><strong>HOST:</strong> Thank you, Mr. CEO. On the other line we have UNION LOCAL SPOKESPERSON WITH ZERO MEDIA EXPERIENCE, hello — can you tell us why you’ve gone on strike?</p>
<p data-sourcepos="11:1-11:58"><strong>UNION:</strong> We’re not on strike. We’ve been locked out.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="14:1-14:17">&lt;awkward pause&gt;</p>
<p data-sourcepos="18:1-18:74"><strong>HOST:</strong> Yes, well, but why haven’t you negotiated an agreement by now?</p>
<p data-sourcepos="20:1-20:264"><strong>UNION:</strong> All of their proposals that don’t harm current workers create a second tier of compensation whereby new workers get shitty wages and pensions — pitting one generation against the other and ringing the death knell of my organization. This is bad.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="22:1-22:85"><strong>HOST:</strong> What about the fact that they’re out of money, for salaries and pensions?</p>
<p data-sourcepos="24:1-24:175"><strong>UNION:</strong> The CEO lied. Their numbers are outrageously disingenuous, and as you can see from our slightly misleading figures our proposals are reasonable and we should be OK.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="26:1-26:69"><strong>HOST:</strong> But what of the people affected by this service disruption?</p>
<p data-sourcepos="28:1-28:120"><strong>UNION</strong>: &lt;unsympathetic divagation about labour law details audience doesn’t understand, exhortation for solidarity&gt;</p>
<p data-sourcepos="30:1-30:149"><strong>HOST:</strong> Whelp we’re just about running out of time Mr. UNION LOCAL SPOKESPERSON, because we now have a bullshit man on the street segment. Linda?</p>
<p data-sourcepos="32:1-32:99"><strong>LINDA:</strong> I’m standing here in front of BUSY TRANSIT HUB and we’ve been speaking to COMMUTERS.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="34:1-34:63"><strong>DUDE IN SPORTS JERSEY 1:</strong> I have no idea what this is about.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="36:1-36:101"><strong>BUSINESS CASUAL LADY 2:</strong> I thought I was affected by this but on close inspection am actually not.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="38:1-38:141"><strong>FROTHING IDIOT 3:</strong> What I don’t understand is why should they get pensions using my tax dollars when the rest of us honest folk don’t?</p>
<p data-sourcepos="40:1-40:54"><strong>LINDA:</strong> As you can see, HOST, opinions are divided!</p>
<p data-sourcepos="42:1-42:99"><strong>HOST:</strong> Thank you, Linda. We’ll keep an eye out on this situation as the labour unrest unfolds.</p>
