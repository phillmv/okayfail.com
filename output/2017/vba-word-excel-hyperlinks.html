<p data-sourcepos="3:1-3:136">I assume you’re reading this because it came up via a search engine, so I put all the snippets first and my motivating story at the end.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="5:1-5:238">All of the following snippets of code are executed within the context of a Word document. I lightly edited the code and changed some variable and function names, so I make no guarantees that the code will copy and paste in without errors.</p>

<p data-sourcepos="40:1-40:366">One of the workhorses in Microsoft Office is the concept of a ‘Range’, which represents a subset of the document you’re editing. You execute searches on a Range, which will then ‘select’ the sub-subset of the document you’re interested in. A Word document, as far as I can tell, consists of many ‘Stories’, which stand in for the different sections of the document.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="42:1-42:259">In order to search through an <em>entire</em> document (i.e. main body, headers, footnotes, etc), we must iterate through the Range that represents each ‘Story’. Also, a Story may contain subranges. I found the original source of this code through VBA documentation.</p>

<p data-sourcepos="222:1-222:92">Recently, as a favour, I was asked to step in and perform some Microsoft Office automation.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="224:1-224:386">A legal firm was producing a lengthy court submission with thousands of citations. These citations all referenced existing files. This submission would be delivered on a USB key along side the files it cited.  The trick was, they wanted their submitted document to link directly to these files, as they came up in footnotes. Like any website, except only referencing a local filesystem.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="226:1-226:270">They were <em>extremely</em> short for time, the intern that normally handled this was away on exams, and every other computer person they knew turned them down. All I had to do was parse a spreadsheet, search through a Word file and insert a relative link in the right place.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="228:1-228:103">I said sure, how hard could it be? and promptly wildly underestimated how long this task would take me.</p>
