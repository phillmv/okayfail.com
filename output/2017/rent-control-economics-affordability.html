    <h5 class="date"><a href="rent-control-economics-affordability.html">November 14, 2017</a> </h5>
    <p data-sourcepos="1:1-1:65">This is the second part of a three part series on rent controls.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="3:1-3:365">In <a href="rent-control-ontario-housing-supply.html">the first part</a>, I examined the history and impact of rent controls in the province of Ontario — and how two other policy changes, unrelated to controls, are more likely to be the actual main disincentives acting on our rental housing supply. I recommend you read that piece before continuing with this one.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="5:1-5:256">In this article, I briefly review the literature and question the theoretical basis on which rent controls are criticized. I look up empirical research on rent controls in other communities and quickly discuss the nature of affordable housing development.</p>

<a id="a-theoretical-overview" class="anchor" href="rent-control-economics-affordability.html#a-theoretical-overview" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>A theoretical overview</h3>
<p data-sourcepos="9:1-9:221">The point of this series isn’t to say that price controls are a paragon of virtue, but instead to critically examine the received wisdom: the picture is rather murkier than that shown in in the standard textbook analysis.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="11:1-11:468">One major problem with this discussion is that there are actually many qualitatively different kinds of rent controls, which different regions have experimented with over different periods of time. When designing a control, we can decide when and how prices increase, whether they track inflation or another indicator, whether capital expenditures can be recovered, at what rate vacant units can reset to what the market will bear (if at all), and so on.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="rent-control-economics-affordability.html#fn-nota-bene-2" id="fnref-nota-bene-2" data-footnote-ref>1</a></sup></p>
<p data-sourcepos="13:1-13:547">Richard Arnott, in a widely read paper from 1995, broadly categorizes rent control policy into two distinct phases.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="rent-control-economics-affordability.html#fn-arnott-original" id="fnref-arnott-original" data-footnote-ref>2</a></sup> The first wave, or generation, of controls were enacted around World War II and they imposed nominal rent freezes tied to individual units. In a planned war economy that lacked much in the way of private housing construction, this made a certain amount of sense; but afterwards most regions dismantled their controls and only New York City (and some European cities) maintained that wartime policy.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="rent-control-economics-affordability.html#fn-arnott-1995" id="fnref-arnott-1995" data-footnote-ref>3</a></sup></p>
<p data-sourcepos="15:1-15:624">The second generation began in the 1970s as rent control ordinances were passed in Boston, Los Angeles, San Francisco and in a variety of towns in California, Massachussetts, New Jersey, New York, etc. The structure of Canadian governance saw these policies accumulate at the provincial level, and during this period ten provinces also enacted rent controls (though most have since abandoned them). These policies “differed significantly from the first-generation rent control programs” and usually allowed automatic increases in rent, the passing through of additional costs, and other like-minded provisions.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="rent-control-economics-affordability.html#fn-arnott-1995" id="fnref-arnott-1995-2" data-footnote-ref>3</a></sup></p>
<p data-sourcepos="17:1-17:628">Separating controls into “hard” and “soft” is not especially useful, though. Hans Lind, writing in 2001, goes on to define five distinct functional types of rent control. In his view, regulations can protect sitting tenants from being charged above-market rents (type A), or from increases in rent unattached to increases in costs (type B). Alternatively, regulations can instead bind to units and prevent landlords anywhere from charging above-market rents (type C), prevent rapid inflation by smoothing increases (type D) or, finally, prevent rents from ever reaching actual market prices (type E).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="rent-control-economics-affordability.html#fn-lind-2001" id="fnref-lind-2001" data-footnote-ref>4</a></sup> <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="rent-control-economics-affordability.html#fn-note-on-lind" id="fnref-note-on-lind" data-footnote-ref>5</a></sup></p>
<p data-sourcepos="19:1-19:725">The takeaway here is that when we talk about regulations, we have to be specific since their goals, mechanisms and therefore impacts are going to be different. New York City’s rent controls, which Lind identifies as an extreme version of a type E control,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="rent-control-economics-affordability.html#fn-lind-2001" id="fnref-lind-2001-2" data-footnote-ref>4</a></sup> are the most famous and well studied example, and consequently critics are quick to conflate all rent regulation with the kind experienced there.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="rent-control-economics-affordability.html#fn-widely-cited-2" id="fnref-widely-cited-2" data-footnote-ref>6</a></sup> That tendency is unfortunate, since in doing so they perform a sleight of hand: New York City’s complex and overlapping rent regulations were enacted at different points of time,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="rent-control-economics-affordability.html#fn-nycrgb-2016" id="fnref-nycrgb-2016" data-footnote-ref>7</a></sup> and therefore its experience is idiosyncratic and unlikely to be directly applicable to other cities.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="21:1-21:620">Of course, they’re not wrong to criticize nominal rent freezes: obviously, a control regime that over time lowers real income below that of real expenditures is a <em>bad idea</em>. It transforms rental properties into endless money pits. It’s fine, and likely necessary, to subsidize some or other aspect of how we produce or provide housing units in order to achieve our policy goals — but it’s unreasonable to expect that subsidy to be provided to the exclusive detriment of individual landlords. If investors wish to transfer their wealth to tenants they don’t need to go through the trouble of erecting a building.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="23:1-23:120">But that’s a false choice. We’re not limited to between an unfettered market and a ruinously restrictive price control.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="25:1-25:554">When economists discuss losses in efficiency, allocation and welfare, they’re comparing our real world with an idealized “perfectly competitive” market where landlords compete to produce homogeneous housing units, there are no externalities, every actor possesses perfect information, and so on. In this view, a landlord faced with increased demand is free to increase prices and profits accordingly. Abnormally high profits, though, attract other potential landlords who by virtue of adding to the supply of apartments will then drive down their prices.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="27:1-27:625">Given a perfect market any sketch on a napkin will show that if prices are not allowed to rise with demand then new entrants will stay put, supply will not increase, and shortages will follow. However, given perfect competition, the market prices any landlord can fetch will over the long run equal their marginal cost, i.e. the amortized cost of building and operating a housing unit plus the landlord’s opportunity cost. Put another way, in a <em>well functioning market</em> it’s more or less unreasonable to expect the rents any given landlord is able to extract will grow much faster than costs and inflation.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="rent-control-economics-affordability.html#fn-arnott-monopoly" id="fnref-arnott-monopoly" data-footnote-ref>8</a></sup></p>
<p data-sourcepos="29:1-29:673">The implication here is that while absolute price ceilings can be and are harmful there is no obvious reason why price <em>smoothing</em> such that increases match but do not exceed costs should have a strong effect on the incentive to create new rental housing.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="rent-control-economics-affordability.html#fn-arnott-2003" id="fnref-arnott-2003" data-footnote-ref>9</a></sup> Writing in 2001, Alastair McFarlane developed an econometric model of rent stabilization and concluded that “because allowing fully flexible base rents permits landlords to capture all of the advantages of a rent growth control, neither the timing nor the density of development will be affected by rent stabilization”, though landlords are incentivized to redevelop sooner than later.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="rent-control-economics-affordability.html#fn-macfarlane-2001" id="fnref-macfarlane-2001" data-footnote-ref>10</a></sup></p>
<p data-sourcepos="31:1-31:458">Trivially, investment in multi-residential buildings is a function of one’s cost of equity, cost of financing and net operating income; developers may invest in a project expecting significant growth in their net operating income, but in a competitive market that is a rather risky assumption. Therefore, even in the absence of rent controls, projects by and large must be cashflow positive given rents available immediately post-construction.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="rent-control-economics-affordability.html#fn-black-2012-4" id="fnref-black-2012-4" data-footnote-ref>11</a></sup></p>
<p data-sourcepos="33:1-33:679">As far as new supply is concerned we can therefore conceive of a non-harmful rent control: if prices increase with costs and inflation, landlord cashflows should largely be unaffected. It’s easy to see why: a cost-adjusted tenancy rent control primarily impacts only one area of the development process: the initial lease up of an empty building.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="rent-control-economics-affordability.html#fn-tait-2017" id="fnref-tait-2017" data-footnote-ref>12</a></sup> Given the long-term nature of multi-residential investment, and provided with the ability to adjust for initial mistakes, over the long run the impact on their finances should be reasonable if not minimal — and their business model can be satisfied so long as cashflows keep up with costs and capital expenditures.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="36:1-36:132">You don’t have to take my word for it. Take GWL Realty Advisors, whose president Paul Finkbeiner was quoted in the <em>Financial Post</em>:</p>
<blockquote data-sourcepos="38:1-38:309">
<p data-sourcepos="38:3-38:309">“We believe there is a strong demand for rental apartments and this property will lease up over time,” Finkbeiner said about his Livmore project, […] “Apartments provide good long-term returns and very low vacancy levels, it’s just one of the best assets classes from a stability point of view.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote data-sourcepos="40:1-40:6">
<p data-sourcepos="40:2-40:6">[…]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote data-sourcepos="42:1-42:354">
<p data-sourcepos="42:3-42:354">GWL seems to think it can work within the new provincial rules. “As a developer, we are building something that will last for 25-50 years that works for tenants,” said Finkbeiner. “We want long-term renters which is also consistent with our investors that are long-term in nature. These buildings go to pay pensions and people’s investments.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote data-sourcepos="44:1-44:166">
<p data-sourcepos="44:3-44:166">He noted Ontario still allows rents to be raised to market level once a tenant leaves a unit and capital improvements to buildings can also be passed on to tenants.</p>

<p data-sourcepos="46:3-46:210">“All we want is a fair rent for our apartments, we do not want above guidelines.

<p data-sourcepos="51:1-51:301">Recall that Ontario’s current rent control regime pegs rents to inflation, does not control rents between tenants, and allows cost pass through.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="rent-control-economics-affordability.html#fn-depressing" id="fnref-depressing" data-footnote-ref>14</a></sup> Lind categorized it as a type B control,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="rent-control-economics-affordability.html#fn-lind-2001" id="fnref-lind-2001-3" data-footnote-ref>4</a></sup> and elsewhere it is variously called a kind of tenancy rent control or rent stabilization.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="53:1-53:448">We saw in <a href="rent-control-ontario-housing-supply.html">the first article</a> that though Ontario’s previous rent control regimes may have been harmful, they were unlikely to be the main disincentives acting on supply — and especially so since 1998, when vacancies were decontrolled and new construction was exempted entirely. Since we need to compare apples-to-apples, what other evidence can we draw for the impacts of type B rent controls?</p>
<p data-sourcepos="55:1-55:576">Consider Manitoba, whose regulation scheme is broadly similar<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="rent-control-economics-affordability.html#fn-note-on-mb" id="fnref-note-on-mb" data-footnote-ref>15</a></sup> and has regulated rents since roughly 1976. Hugh Grant, writing in 2011, argues that there is no evidence that Manitoba’s rent regulation program had a negative effect on the supply of new, or maintenance of existing, rental properties. Manitoba at the time was experiencing a low vacancy rate, which Grant attributed to a rapid influx of immigration, and a relatively inelastic supply due to large planning-to-completion time lags and uncertainty about future rates of population growth.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="rent-control-economics-affordability.html#fn-grant-2011" id="fnref-grant-2011" data-footnote-ref>16</a></sup></p>
<p data-sourcepos="57:1-57:642">In New Jersey, over one hundred municipalities have enacted their own rent controls. Each city implemented their regulation differently, but by and large they all permit automatic increases, passing on capital improvements, etc; almost half also engage in vacancy decontrol. In 2015 Joshua Ambrosius et al used the 2010 United States Census and compared the regulated cities with unregulated cities. They found that, once they controlled for other factors, New Jersey rent control policies had no statistical impact on rental quality, rental supply, property appreciation or foreclosure rates in the cities that enacted them.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="rent-control-economics-affordability.html#fn-ambrosius-2015" id="fnref-ambrosius-2015" data-footnote-ref>17</a></sup></p>
<p data-sourcepos="59:1-59:346">In fact, tenancy rent controls seem to barely control rents at all. Earlier this year Graham Haines analyzed Ontario’s rent regulations and developed a model that estimated that “the discounted cumulative income earned by the rent controlled building was between 98.5% and 99.0% of that earned by the non-rent controlled building”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="rent-control-economics-affordability.html#fn-haines-2017" id="fnref-haines-2017" data-footnote-ref>18</a></sup></p>
<p data-sourcepos="61:1-61:426">This finding is corroborated by both the Manitoba and the New Jersey study cited above. In New Jersey, median rents in rent controlled cities were found to be roughly the same as rents in non-controlled cities.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="rent-control-economics-affordability.html#fn-ambrosius-2015-2" id="fnref-ambrosius-2015-2" data-footnote-ref>19</a></sup> In Manitoba, Grant argues “there is no evidence that rent regulations have restricted rents below what would prevail in a perfectly-competitive market under equilibrium conditions”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="rent-control-economics-affordability.html#fn-grant-2011-2" id="fnref-grant-2011-2" data-footnote-ref>20</a></sup></p>
<p data-sourcepos="63:1-63:854">Though they do not quite confirm to my criteria above, two other studies are worth mentioning. Frank Denton et al, in a 1993 report commissioned by the CMHC, developed an econometric model and conducted an extensive empirical investigation of the impact of rent controls on Canadian housing markets. They concluded that “there is no evidence that controls influence the long-run rate of increase of rents”, nor did they impact housing starts or maintenance though they may lower vacancy rates.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="rent-control-economics-affordability.html#fn-denton-1993" id="fnref-denton-1993" data-footnote-ref>21</a></sup> Celia Lazzarin analyzed rent regulations in British Columbia from 1974 to 1984 for her 1990 master’s thesis. She found that basically there were too many confounding variables (demographics, unemployment, interest and inflation rates, migration, etc) to attribute the declines in Vancouver’s rental supply solely to rent controls.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="rent-control-economics-affordability.html#fn-lazzarin-1990" id="fnref-lazzarin-1990" data-footnote-ref>22</a></sup></p>
<!--<h3>Allocation concerns are misplaced</h3>

I would like to address a few other criticisms. 

The first, advanced most notably by Edward Glaeser et al in 2003, is that by keeping rent prices down rent controls prevent the Pareto efficient allocation of housing to those who most value them &mdash; and that these misallocation costs can create greater social losses than the mere undersupply of housing. The canonical sympathetic example is that of a lonely widow occupying a three bedroom long past her actual need for the extra space. Glaeser et al created an econometric model whereby they rank preferences in housing size by socio-economic groups living in Hartford, CT and in Chicago, IL, and compare them to the same groups living in Manhattan. They conclude that about 20 percent of apartments in New York City are misallocated.[^glaeser-2003]

I think this analysis is rather puzzling, for a few reasons. First, the observation that tenants in Hartford, CT will have a larger apartment than their socio-economic peers living in an apartment building with more than five units in Manhattan seems trivial and meaningless given the variation in housing stock, city amenities, etc. Second, when applying their analysis to their placebo markets they find that, contrary to their expectations, Chicago and Hartford also show signs of misallocation &mdash; and for that reason caution readers against embracing their results "too enthusiastically".[^glaeser-2003]

Most importantly, the entire analysis encodes a normative assumption that property rights should override tenure rights, and we can most vividly imagine this by applying the same inference to ownership housing. Suppose instead that the hypothetical lonely widow owns her unit outright and it becomes hard to imagine an equivalent paper arguing that her property rights should be abrogated and the widow forcibly evicted in order to improve the allocation of housing. Indeed, Glaeser et al also find that their sample of NYC owned units have a higher degree of misallocation than their placebo groups in Chicago or Hartford &mdash; but this seems to elicit no discussion or need for a policy response.[^glaeser-2003] [^nota-bene-3]

Quickly, a similar argument is made elsewhere with regard to the cost of mismatching labour to jobs; rent controls disincentivize job seekers from moving closer to work, since their housing costs will likely increase. I think this is also puzzling, for the same reason as above: this analysis is not applied to homeownership. Transaction and moving costs are if anything higher for homeowners, and the extent to which incentivizing homeownership is the sole driving focus of much of our housing policy apparatus renders this argument moot.

It's not clear to me why we should apply these arguments to one kind of housing tenure and not another.-->

<p data-sourcepos="81:1-81:162">There is one noticeable disadvantage to a tenancy rent control: in tight markets the delta between long term tenant rates and market rates can grow rather large.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="83:1-83:716">Because rents reset between tenants, landlords therefore may try to select for shorter term tenancies (i.e. by preferring students over families) and building smaller units. Lawrence Smith wrote about this in 2003, as well as Richard Arnott.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="rent-control-economics-affordability.html#fn-smith-2003" id="fnref-smith-2003" data-footnote-ref>23</a></sup> <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="rent-control-economics-affordability.html#fn-arnott-2003" id="fnref-arnott-2003-2" data-footnote-ref>9</a></sup> I think we can ameliorate that by moderately controlling vacancies, paired with a temporary exemption for new construction. If inter-tenancy rent increases are restricted by 10 or even 5% over inflation we reduce the incentive for high tenancy turnover, smooth rapid price increases across the market, and preserve the normal incentive structure described above.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="rent-control-economics-affordability.html#fn-vacancy-control" id="fnref-vacancy-control" data-footnote-ref>24</a></sup> However, rent prices over time would still approach market rates.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="85:1-85:439">Keeping some rents below market prices has another detrimental effect: it encourages property owners to economically evict their tenants via renovations or to convert to unregulated forms of tenure. <a href="rent-control-ontario-housing-supply.html">In part 1 of this series</a>, I reviewed Lawrence Smith’s 1988 paper which mentions this for Toronto, and earlier I cited McFarlane.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="rent-control-economics-affordability.html#fn-macfarlane-2001" id="fnref-macfarlane-2001-2" data-footnote-ref>10</a></sup> I’ve chosen to highlight two other papers.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="87:1-87:273">David Sims, writing in 2007, examined what happened after Massachusetts ended rent controls in 1994. He argues that units in previously controlled areas became 6-7 percentage points more likely to be rented out, i.e. that units were kept from the rental market.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="rent-control-economics-affordability.html#fn-sims-2007" id="fnref-sims-2007" data-footnote-ref>25</a></sup></p>
<p data-sourcepos="89:1-89:579">Rebecca Diamond et al, in a freshly published paper, leveraged a uniquely rich dataset. In 1994, the city of San Francisco extended its rent regulation to buildings with 4 or fewer rental units built before 1980 (about 30% of the rental stock). Combining a private data provider with property records, they were able to follow individual San Francisco tenants occupying regulated and unregulated housing units from 1994 to the present day. They found “that rent-controlled buildings were almost 10 percent more likely to convert to a condo or a Tenancy in Common”.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="rent-control-economics-affordability.html#fn-diamond-2017" id="fnref-diamond-2017" data-footnote-ref>26</a></sup></p>
<p data-sourcepos="91:1-91:455">There is some reason to doubt these numbers prima facie, since converted housing units remain part of the housing stock — and a large percentage of condominiums get rented out to tenants without this necessarily being reflected in most housing data sources (though it seems that Diamond’s dataset mostly controls for this). It may be more accurate to say that primary rental units are being converted to ownership <em>and</em> the secondary rental market.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="93:1-93:471">In addition, California’s Ellis Act creates a relatively permissive environment for conversions. Contrast with Massachusetts: Sims found that “rent decontrol is associated with an 8 percentage point increase in the probability of a unit being a condominium”, presumably since conversion restrictions were lifted.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="rent-control-economics-affordability.html#fn-sims-2007" id="fnref-sims-2007-2" data-footnote-ref>25</a></sup> Nevertheless, it seems fair to conclude that keeping units below market rates exacerbates the incentive towards selling them or redeveloping them.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="95:1-95:456">Reading these papers I can’t help but think that the actual problem has more to do with rising land values and the lack of new supply. That regular, continuous growth in market rates makes conversions attractive is not surprising. San Francisco’s property values have appreciated by 550% over the last thirty years,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="rent-control-economics-affordability.html#fn-mclaughlin-2016" id="fnref-mclaughlin-2016" data-footnote-ref>27</a></sup> and it rather famously doesn’t build much in the way of new housing despite creating lots of well paid jobs.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="rent-control-economics-affordability.html#fn-torres-2017" id="fnref-torres-2017" data-footnote-ref>28</a></sup></p>

<p data-sourcepos="99:1-99:705">The essential observation here is that rent controls cause a decline in rentals not because they are rendered unprofitable but because they are crowded out by ownership housing and other, more profitable uses. Today’s land prices set the floor on the rent tomorrow’s new supply needs to extract, and so it seems to me that when we talk about letting rent prices float to market rates we imply that landlords deserve to capture the growth in value immediately rather than just through capital gains. To the extent that land values in certain cities are a function of inelastic supply, capital markets and low interest rates, that seems like a strange reason to support a transfer from tenants to landlords.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="101:1-101:534">Ultimately, our housing crisis is a matter of income: tenants with low incomes have an <em>income</em> problem, not a housing problem.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="rent-control-economics-affordability.html#fn-hswg-final" id="fnref-hswg-final" data-footnote-ref>29</a></sup> <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="rent-control-economics-affordability.html#fn-brescia-2005-3" id="fnref-brescia-2005-3" data-footnote-ref>30</a></sup> Land prices and other costs, driven by restrictive land use policies and the speculative bubble, have grown faster than tenant incomes and pushed financial recovery rents beyond what most of the rental population can afford or finds reasonable. While land prices continue to grow above inflation or wages, maintaining affordable housing stock will continue to be a challenge.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="103:2-103:477">In the absence of subsidy, the private sector is unlikely to build new rental housing for the low end of the market. Though the profitability of building modest cost ownership housing in large volumes can approach that of smaller quantities of high end ownership housing, the same is not true for affordable rentals. It costs only slightly less to build an affordable rental, compared to building high end, but the resulting income stream is substantially smaller.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="rent-control-economics-affordability.html#fn-hswg-2001" id="fnref-hswg-2001" data-footnote-ref>31</a></sup></p>
<p data-sourcepos="105:1-105:707">Relatively affordable privately developed housing, then, occurs because as inflation and mortgage payments decrease carrying costs over time the rent necessary to carry a rental investment decreases. And, through a process called filtering, new high-end housing creates vacancies lower in the chain as people move on up to occupy new supply. In theory, as the existing housing stock ages and deteriorates, people with higher incomes will tend to prefer newer, higher quality housing.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="rent-control-economics-affordability.html#fn-brescia-2005-2" id="fnref-brescia-2005-2" data-footnote-ref>32</a></sup> In practice, as housing preferences change and formerly ‘downtrodden’ areas become trendy, the filtering chain can get interrupted as higher-income people renovate and move into formerly lower-income areas.</p>

<p data-sourcepos="109:1-109:281">Commentators criticizing rent controls often point to New York City as a negative example but that city’s experience is rather idiosyncratic. The design and implementation of rent controls varies so much that we must be careful and specific when making comparing different regions.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="111:1-111:344">While first-generation controls were likely as harmful as described, there is no theoretical reason why a well-designed rent control should disincentivize new construction. So long as landlords can recover increases in costs their business models should be unaffected, and this outcome is confirmed by several theoretical and empirical studies.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="113:1-113:424">However, a well-designed rent control over the long run allows rents to reach market rates and therefore does not directly help with affordability. A well-designed rent control allows landlords to pass through capital expenditures and somewhat incentivizes renovations, and therefore does not directly help with gentrification. Rent controls are not the best tools for preserving affordability or preventing gentrification.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="115:1-115:118">What <em>are</em> rent controls good for, then? That a regulation is relatively neutral does not justify its implementation.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="117:1-117:253">In <a href="rent-control-security-tenure-public-good.html">the third and final part of this series</a>, we will look at security of tenure, and why ensuring its provision is justified — and well within our history of housing policies and interventions.</p>

<p data-sourcepos="250:21-250:460">Arnott makes the case that housing markets are actually monopolistically competitive since housing structures and preferences are not homogenous, there are substantial asymmetries in information, and transactions costs are non-trivial. Consequently, rents are set higher than their efficient level and the corresponding deadweight loss can be mitigated (Arnott 2003, p. 106).
