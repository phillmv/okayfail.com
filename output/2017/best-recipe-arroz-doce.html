      <!--<h3>Saying goodbye to my grandmother; rice pudding and the kindest place on youtube</h3>-->
<a href="http://localhost:3000/img/auroraeasmeninas2.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://localhost:3000/img/auroraeasmeninas2.jpg" title="my mother, my aunt, my grandmother Aurora" style="max-width:100%;"></a>
<p data-sourcepos="4:1-4:49">Right at my beginning, there was my grandmother.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="6:1-6:323">She flew in after I was born and spent three months looking after me while my mother recovered. So I was told. I remember little of my early childhood; but she was there, sporadically. We visited them in Portugal. There are photos of my maternal grandfather, holding me as a toddler, standing on our front porch in Toronto.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="8:1-8:288">When my mother was diagnosed, my grandmother dropped everything and flew over again. After, my parents moved us back to Portugal. When my mother passed away and my father checked out with grief, my grandmother assumed her role of worrier-in-chief and lead the charge in looking after me.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="10:1-10:101">She dressed in her drab mourning clothes, wiped her hands on her apron, and made sure I was alright.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="12:1-12:401">I lived with my grandparents for about a year, and then spent every school holiday with them. In the summer, we went to the Algarve and stayed in a camping park across the street from the beach. During the school year, they drove up every other week to the small village I lived in with my dad, just to hang out. She worried about us, all by ourselves. My grandmother would clean, do laundry and cook.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="14:1-14:336">In her telling, a lot of my grandmother’s stories centered around food. The first solid meal I ever had was breaded goat brains, which she spoon fed into me. Twenty or thirty years later, she remembered with precision the feast she improvised for my parents’ wedding or carefully prepared for my baptism or coordinated for Party events.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="16:1-16:488">Everyone praised Aurora’s cooking. Her rapini or tomato risotto improved any meal. She made a mean barbeque (allow it to rest in a pot, and add lemon juice and butter) and the tastiest french fries, with deep fried garlic on the side. She prepared delightful rabbit stews in the pressure cooker, the carrots juicy with flavour. She knew all the ways around cod: she stripped it into a salad, she deep fried pastéis and pataniscas, and she baked bacalhau com natas and bacalhau à Brás.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="18:1-18:438">One dish was a regular refrain. Her arroz doce, ‘sweet rice’ - a cinnamony rice pudding. The rice is cooked in milk with cinnamon and sweetened to taste and painted yellow with egg yolk. It is soft and rich, easy to make and comforting. Out in the camping park where we spent our summers, she was famous for it: neighborhood ladies competed to best her. But as far as I’m concerned, arroz doce tastes like a cozy, rainy winter afternoon.</p>

<p data-sourcepos="30:1-30:128">Eventually, my father and I moved back to Canada, and I saw her less often. Once, maybe twice a year. We still spoke every week.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="32:1-32:280">When you only see family in snapshots like that, they age and become frail with terrifying speed. I knew that, before long, I’d come to regret not making more of an effort to remember. I grew up feeling the negative space my mother occupied around me. I’ve always known the score.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="34:1-36:4">I began to take pictures.<br>
<br><br>
<br></p>

<br>
I wanted to capture the feeling I had around them.

<br>
Of the most stable space I ever had growing up. A place that from my perspective, barely changed at all.

<br>
Where I was aways welcome and wanted.

<p data-sourcepos="64:1-64:310">In 2011, she passed away. I’d arranged to come visit, but she died three days before my flight was due. It came as a shock, unexpected, but I remember feeling unsettled the night before. Something was wrong. I remember being shaken awake by the 5am phone call, my grandfather gasping, inaudible, <em>she’s gone</em>.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="66:1-66:216">Life is like that, sometimes. Everything changes. She’d been sick for years, but she was an expert at pretending everything was alright. Worrying was something she did for other people; she was just fine, thank you.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="68:1-68:301">I later found out that she’d spent a month or two that year in the hospital, jaundiced, and over the phone had pretended she was out or in a restaurant. Had I known, I’d have managed to say goodbye, I’d have visited sooner. Our last conversation was rushed: I’d be seeing her in a little over a week.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="70:1-70:57">I stepped off the plane and went straight to her funeral.</p>
<br>
<a href="http://localhost:3000/img/aurora.funeral.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://localhost:3000/img/aurora.funeral.jpg" title="my mother, my aunt, my grandmother Aurora" style="max-width:100%;"></a>
<br>
<br>
<p data-sourcepos="77:1-77:369">She was kind, she was sassy, she had a quick wit, she was a tough lady. Her father died when she was a young girl, crushed between two trains at Braço de Prata. Her older brother drowned soon after at the age of twenty, her mother left alone to raise three or four, I forget. She knew privation. Like many people her age, she was only afforded a grade three education.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="79:1-79:210">She rarely set a foot outside of her house without being well coiffed and presentable, clean clothes and tidy appearance. She would get ready, drive ten minutes to my aunt’s house, and change into work clothes.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="81:1-81:311">She held grudges. She collected grievances, and aired at to me at regular intervals, suddenly walking into the room, asking, I’m not interrupting am I?, and launching into stories forty years past, most of the protagonists now gone. She took great delight in the pranks she played on her coworkers in her youth.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="83:1-83:273">She was there for me. She used to tuck me in at night. When the time came, my grandfather and I cleaned out the drawer she kept in the office; next to her vintage Party pamphlets, postcards, and expired id cards was a cache of my childhood drawings she had squirreled away.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="85:1-85:18">We threw them out.</p>
<hr data-sourcepos="87:1-88:0">
<p data-sourcepos="89:1-89:400">In 2010, I documented my grandmother cooking arroz doce, walking through every step. As a boy-child I wasn’t really expected to do domestic labour, so not learning how to cook was easy. The video sat on my harddrive; I made it once, with a friend, on the day she died. In 2012, concerned about accidental data loss, I finally gathered the energy to stitch the video together and posted it on youtube.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="92:1-92:309">I didn’t expect anything to happen. I checked in a year later - and it had ten thousand views! Some people were watching. I figured this recipe might as well become the <em>canonical recipe</em> for arroz doce. I renamed it to “A Melhor Receita de Arroz Doce” (The Best Arroz Doce Recipe) and put my faith in Google.</p>

<br>
<p data-sourcepos="100:1-100:224">It’s been five years now, and it just crossed the 400,000 view mark. It’s by far the single most popular thing I’ve ever made. People have spent a cumulative 2 years and 289 days watching it, which is a mind boggling figure.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="102:1-102:245">I’ve done nothing to promote it. An algorithm somewhere decided people needed to see it. Youtube will suggest it to people browsing portuguese cooking videos and, if you google it, it’s buried, but it’s right there on the first page of results.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="104:1-104:240">I’m not sure this is what my grandmother would’ve wanted, exactly; she wasn’t all that keen on sharing her recipes. But it gives <em>me</em> a lot of satisfaction: hardly a week goes by without this video producing yet another tiny bit of delight.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="106:1-106:99">You see, people leave comments. They leave <em>great</em> comments. I’ve translated a few of them for you.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="108:1-108:44">People write in to say they love the recipe:</p>

<p data-sourcepos="143:1-143:65">Every week, I get an email notification with something like this.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="145:1-145:42">I think it shows there’s hope for us yet.</p>
