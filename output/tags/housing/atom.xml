    <title>British Columbia is YIMBYer than California</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;h3 data-sourcepos="1:1-1:120"&gt;
&lt;a id="comparing-new-dwelling-building-permits-per-capita-per-year-between-select-us-states-and-select-canadian-provinces" class="anchor" href="#comparing-new-dwelling-building-permits-per-capita-per-year-between-select-us-states-and-select-canadian-provinces" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Comparing new dwelling building permits per capita per year between select U.S. states and select Canadian provinces&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="3:1-3:230"&gt;Canada is downstream of American culture, and Canadian housing discourse is no different. In the great, fiery, online fights about housing, Californians in particular are over-represented and tend to drive the terms of the debate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="5:1-5:330"&gt;And so, when it comes to our own online twitter housing discourse, many Canadians have noticeably “Californian” terms of reference. Namely, folks tend to adopt a semi-reductive fixation on the supply of private market housing, which is being severely stifled by excessive deference to the interests of incumbent, NIMBY homeowners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="7:1-7:147"&gt;This is fine as far as stylized causal narratives go. But if we’ve adopted the same causal narratives, how do our housing markets actually compare?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="9:1-9:62"&gt;In other words, how bad are &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; NIMBYs, relatively speaking?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="11:1-11:203"&gt;On close examination, using new dwelling building permits as a proxy for new housing construction, I find that on average Canadian provinces produce way more housing than California or New York state do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="13:1-13:174"&gt;&lt;a href="/2021/british-columbia-more-yimby-california/files/average-bldg-permits-2011-2020.png" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="/2021/british-columbia-more-yimby-california/files/average-bldg-permits-2011-2020.png" alt="Average building permits for new dwellings per year per 1,000 residents in 2011-2020" style="max-width:100%;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="15:1-15:172"&gt;(Click &lt;a href="/2021/british-columbia-more-yimby-california/files/comparing-building-permits-per-capita-between-america-canada.phillmv.xlsx"&gt;here for a copy of the spreadsheets&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="17:1-17:191"&gt;For the average California YIMBY, the status quo in British Columbia is a &lt;em&gt;success condition&lt;/em&gt;: BC on average issues three times more building permits per capita per year than California does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-sourcepos="19:1-19:13"&gt;
&lt;a id="motivation" class="anchor" href="#motivation" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="21:1-21:489"&gt;In 2017, I became somewhat familiar with Canadian housing statistics and academic literature, and one thing I learned while &lt;a href="http://okayfail.com/2018/rent-control-great-security-of-tenure.html"&gt;writing about rent control&lt;/a&gt; is that every jurisdiction manages to do things differently. As I continued to see American commentators cite Toronto and Vancouver as positive examples worth emulating, I developed a vibe that our housing crisis must have some important qualitative differences, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="23:1-23:308"&gt;In particular, I was fairly confident that Canadian cities produce a lot more housing, relatively speaking, than their American counterparts. The other day I got into a twitter conversation with &lt;a href="https://doodles.mountainmath.ca/"&gt;Jens von Bergmann&lt;/a&gt;, and it occurred to me that I could try to sketch this out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-sourcepos="25:1-25:13"&gt;
&lt;a id="hypothesis" class="anchor" href="#hypothesis" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Hypothesis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="27:1-27:163"&gt;If Canadian cities produce more housing, relatively speaking, than similar American cities, then this should stand out if we compare their construction statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="29:1-29:424"&gt;Housing regulations are highly localized and so ideally we’d compare individual cities directly. But when making international comparisons definitions like “what is a city?” can get pretty flimsy. Also, we’re just interested in the general picture. These kinds of differences ought to show up at the sub-regional level, and entities like provinces or U.S. states tend to have more stable definitions than metropolitan areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="31:1-31:339"&gt;Because provinces and states have different sizes, comparing absolute numbers isn’t particularly meaningful. We’ll need to normalize housing unit construction statistics by each area’s respective population. Also, housing construction rates can vary a lot on any given year, so we’ll have to average our statistics across a bunch of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-sourcepos="33:1-33:14"&gt;
&lt;a id="methodology" class="anchor" href="#methodology" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Methodology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="35:1-35:131"&gt;An important caveat is I had to time box this analysis to two hours, which is all the time I had while the baby slept.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-time-spent" id="fnref-time-spent" data-footnote-ref&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="37:1-37:264"&gt;OK! Let’s find some data. We are interested in the regulatory bottleneck to new housing, so I figured we could use new housing starts, which are easy to get from the CMHC website. All I had to do now was to find a source of new housing starts data for U.S. states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="39:1-39:498"&gt;I searched for variants on “california housing starts statistics” for a good half an hour without finding anything useful. I was surprised there’s no equivalent to our reasonably decent StatCan website. There’s a &lt;a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/HOUST"&gt;FRED table&lt;/a&gt; but seemingly no way to break it down by state. There’s the &lt;a href="https://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/index.html"&gt;New Residential Construction&lt;/a&gt; data release, but the only available breakdowns are by region and not by state. Weird!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="41:1-41:432"&gt;Surely I’m missing something? American researchers seem to have access to all sorts of interesting surveys and data series on rental prices and residential construction that we lack. Maybe data is only aggregated on a state by state level; maybe you need to know a guy to get it. Either way, I couldn’t find any one-stop-shop portals with historical data on housing starts or completions with state-level (or MSA-level) granularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="43:1-43:427"&gt;What I did find was the &lt;a href="https://www.census.gov/construction/bps/"&gt;Building Permits Survey&lt;/a&gt;, which should be a rough proxy for actual building starts.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-building-starts" id="fnref-building-starts" data-footnote-ref&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Poking thru StatCan yielded &lt;a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/cv.action?pid=3410006601"&gt;Table 34-10-0066-01  Building permits, by type of structure and type of work (x 1,000)&lt;/a&gt; whose definition seems to be roughly equivalent to the American one. Great!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="45:1-45:243"&gt;I filtered the StatCan table down to ‘Total residential’ and ‘Number of dwelling units-created’. The Canadian building permits table only went back to 2011, so I arbitrarily decided that 2011-2020 was a good enough time period to average over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="47:1-47:256"&gt;On a whim, I decided to compare the four largest Canadian provinces (Ontario, Québec, British Columbia, Alberta) with the four largest U.S. states (California, Texas, Florida, New York) plus Washington which is sort of like, a mirror-universe BC, why not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="49:1-49:477"&gt;I then got population estimates from &lt;a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/cv.action?pid=1710000501"&gt;Table 17-10-0005-01  Population estimates on July 1st, by age and sex&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?id=NYPOP,CAPOP,TXPOP,WAPOP,FLPOP"&gt;{NY,CA,TX,WA,FL}POP data series from FRED&lt;/a&gt;. By using population figures for each individual year for each given state/province should allow us to account for differences in population growth across different state/provinces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="51:1-51:403"&gt;Finally, I dumped all of these tables into Excel, chopped things around, divided the number of issued permits by the number of people in each state or province, multiplied that number by one thousand, and then finally averaged every year together. You can find &lt;a href="/2021/british-columbia-more-yimby-california/files/comparing-building-permits-per-capita-between-america-canada.phillmv.xlsx"&gt;the data here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a id="concluding-thoughts--questions" class="anchor" href="#concluding-thoughts--questions" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Concluding thoughts &amp;amp; questions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p data-sourcepos="56:1-56:214"&gt;No. Not every building permit turns into a housing start, and not every housing start turns into a housing completion. Actual finished housing units are some large fraction of the number of issued building permits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="58:1-58:144"&gt;It’s entirely possible that for ex. jurisdiction A approves a lot more housing than jurisdiction B but actually builds a smaller fraction of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-sourcepos="60:1-60:50"&gt;
&lt;a id="what-does-this-say-about-the-housing-shortage" class="anchor" href="#what-does-this-say-about-the-housing-shortage" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What does this say about the housing shortage?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="62:1-62:131"&gt;The only concrete observation we can make here is that Canadian provinces tend to issue more building permits than American states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="64:1-64:231"&gt;British Columbia may issue three times the permits per capita that California does, but as long as the demand for housing is higher in British Columbia than it is in California, then prices will continue to be out of whack.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-weird" id="fnref-weird" data-footnote-ref&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-sourcepos="68:1-68:255"&gt;That said, I think we can also note that while Canadian jurisdictions may have a NIMBY problem, whatever we do experience here is &lt;em&gt;very different&lt;/em&gt; from what our American friends are experiencing. Their situation seems to be a lot worse!&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-familiar-refrain" id="fnref-familiar-refrain" data-footnote-ref&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-time-spent"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="78:16-78:161"&gt;For what it’s worth, I spent two hours gathering the data, two hours making the graph look pretty, and another three hours writing this blog post. &lt;a href="#fnref-time-spent" class="footnote-backref" data-footnote-backref aria-label="Back to content"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-building-starts"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="72:21-72:144"&gt;In fact, I later learned that the CMHC’s building starts data builds upon the building permits data. So, it’s all connected. &lt;a href="#fnref-building-starts" class="footnote-backref" data-footnote-backref aria-label="Back to content"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-weird"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="76:11-76:87"&gt;That’s kind of weird, though, right? No shade on BC but California is &lt;em&gt;nice&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href="#fnref-weird" class="footnote-backref" data-footnote-backref aria-label="Back to content"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn-familiar-refrain"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="74:22-74:124"&gt;Canadians will recognize the familiar refrain; sure, we got problems, but at least we’re not &lt;em&gt;America&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href="#fnref-familiar-refrain" class="footnote-backref" data-footnote-backref aria-label="Back to content"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Remote Work Isn't Gentrification</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p data-sourcepos="1:1-1:316"&gt;Before the pandemic, fully remote work was rare. Now, many large tech companies are embracing remote work — and in tandem announcing that &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/05/facebook-workers-get-remote-work-option-but-it-could-come-with-a-pay-cut/"&gt;compensation will be scaled by geographic location&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="3:1-3:279"&gt;This can be a bit awkward. Typically, workers in the SF Bay or NY metro region are able to command large wage premiums but now everyone works from home. Intuitively, it seems odd that equivalently experienced or productive workers are paid (sometimes, substantially) differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="5:1-5:232"&gt;Should tech workers be paid the same across locations? Not everyone thinks so. One disagreement I have seen emerge a few times is centered on the impact of remote work on local housing markets. The argument goes something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-sourcepos="7:1-7:152"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="7:3-7:152"&gt;In San Francisco it is common to see well-heeled tech workers buy up houses, drive up markets, and displace people from their historic neighbourhoods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-sourcepos="9:1-9:155"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="9:3-9:155"&gt;As more and more companies take up remote work, more and more people will be earning tech worker wages while living in regions with lower median incomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-sourcepos="11:1-11:132"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="11:3-11:132"&gt;I feel like these workers will inevitably compete with lower-paid locals for housing, and therefore accelerate their displacement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-sourcepos="13:1-13:90"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="13:3-13:90"&gt;Doesn’t this mean that paying remote workers roughly the same everywhere can be harmful?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="17:1-17:39"&gt;Let’s unpack this a little.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-on-a-lark" id="fnref-on-a-lark" data-footnote-ref&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="19:1-19:236"&gt;In the micro-sense, this is often what gentrification looks like up close. High-income people outcompete low-income people for the same housing units, and thereby displace them to other neighbourhoods, or out of their cities altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="21:1-21:105"&gt;But in the macro-sense, the causal mechanism underpinning gentrification is driven by three broad trends:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol data-sourcepos="23:1-28:0"&gt;
&lt;li data-sourcepos="23:1-24:0"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="23:4-23:147"&gt;Higher productivity returns to “superstar” regions due to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economies_of_agglomeration"&gt;agglomeration effects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-sourcepos="25:1-26:0"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="25:4-25:148"&gt;Inadequate regional &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land-use_planning"&gt;land-use policies&lt;/a&gt; and investment patterns for absorbing population growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-sourcepos="27:1-28:0"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="27:4-27:147"&gt;Growing global wealth inequality fueling &lt;a href="https://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Housing/Pages/FinancializationHousing.aspx"&gt;housing financialization&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="29:1-29:271"&gt;The first trend is why so many people want to live in nice big cities, since there is so much more opportunity. People are paid more to work in San Francisco et al not because it has a higher cost of living, but because it’s so much easier to hop between comparable jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="31:1-31:348"&gt;The second trend is zoning bylaws restricting density, thereby forcing high-income people to compete with low-income people. But it’s simultaneously also a huge underinvestment in public transportation and other public goods, i.e. everyone wants to live near a BART or Caltrain station, or near nice schools, etc, but we don’t build more of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="33:1-33:368"&gt;Finally, the third trend is that, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/12/business/economy/a-relentless-rise-in-unequal-wealth.html"&gt;in the Piketty sense&lt;/a&gt;, Capital’s share of Income is growing faster than Labour’s share of Income, which leads to flush credit markets encouraging over-leveraged investments and private equity firms flush with cash chasing returns, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="35:1-35:461"&gt;While individual high-income households sometimes compete directly with low-income households, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/02/single-family-landlords-wall-street/582394/"&gt;private equity firms that are buying houses by the thousands&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07352166.2019.1705846"&gt;entire apartment buildings by the handful&lt;/a&gt; with the express purpose of renovating them and squeezing out low-income tenants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="37:1-37:150"&gt;To bring this back to tech companies and tech workers, your personal impact on your local housing market really will vary according to where you live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="39:1-39:377"&gt;If you live in an economically depressed area – i.e. Pittsburgh, Detroit, Baltimore, Cleveland, and so on, all cities that today have far fewer residents than they used to, and lots of vacant housing to show for it – it’s a net positive for you to earn more and spend more in your local economy as opposed to just competing for the same scarce resources in the SF Bay Area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="41:1-41:311"&gt;Or, you might just live in an area that has OK housing policy and or is able to grow at a rate capable of equitably accommodating the demand they face. In either case, you’re not displacing anyone. Paying people who live in those regions more is a kind of income-redistribution away from the superstar region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="43:1-43:259"&gt;More broadly, however, is the impact that “being paid less” also has. Whenever a worker is underpaid relative to the value they produce for the organization, that surplus value doesn’t disappear: it’s ultimately captured instead by their shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="45:1-45:247"&gt;For many companies, and this is true for every company in the S&amp;amp;P500, their largest shareholders are institutional investors. This extra capital doesn’t sit still: it’s then reinvested and often used to finance real estate trusts and acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="47:1-47:196"&gt;So in a very real if indirect sense, it is the act of underpaying workers relative to the value they produce that ends up giving firms the excess cash to then go and gentrify their neighbourhoods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="49:1-49:17"&gt;Food for thought!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class="footnotes" data-footnotes&gt;

&lt;li id="fn-on-a-lark"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="51:15-51:384"&gt;In 2017, on a lark, I spent three months researching and writing a &lt;a href="/2018/rent-control-great-security-of-tenure.html"&gt;~40 page paper on the nature of rent control&lt;/a&gt;. This doesn’t make me an expert, but I think I’ve spent more time reading about land use and real estate development patterns and economics than the average bear. Bears, for one, can hardly read at all. &lt;a href="#fnref-on-a-lark" class="footnote-backref" data-footnote-backref aria-label="Back to content"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bailout Landlords, Get Social Housing</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p data-sourcepos="1:1-1:145"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A version of this article was published in &lt;a href="https://readpassage.com/protect-tenants-from-covid-19-by-nationalizing-landlords-assets/"&gt;Passage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="3:1-3:229"&gt;With the economy grinding to a halt due to the social distancing measures and emergency lockdowns imposed in order to fight COVID-19, more than a million of Canadians have lost their jobs and are filing for employment insurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="5:1-5:294"&gt;This poses a unique danger to tenants. A half century of housing and tax policies that discriminate against tenants has highly stratified who rents and who owns their accommodations by income — as of 2016, the average household income of Canadian homeowners was nearly double that of renters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="7:1-7:372"&gt;Many tenants are now, or soon will be, having to choose between buying groceries and paying rent, as the government’s support programs exclude a great deal of people. Moreover, while many homeowners are being allowed to defer their mortgage payments, tenants have yet to receive any targeted support, other than formal evictions being put on hold in much of the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="9:1-9:413"&gt;A pause on formal evictions, however, isn’t good enough. Many evictions happen informally, through harassment, intimidation or a simple desire on the tenant’s part to move on and not get into a protracted fight. Landlords as a class aren’t renowned for their charity, and we’ve already begun to hear about tenants being threatened and locked out, including a nurse working 15-hour days to fight COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="11:1-11:450"&gt;Many people are at real risk of finding themselves homeless during this crisis. This matters even more than usual because, due to decades of inaction, our homeless population is in greater danger due to COVID-19. Our homeless shelters are chronically overcrowded, and it’s impossible to effectively maintain social distancing. As more homeless people test positive for COVID-19, it’s even crueler than usual to be pushing people onto the streets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="13:1-13:834"&gt;This brings us back to landlords. As the rent strike spreads from the residential to the commercial and retail sector, and as the Airbnb short-term rental market has effectively been destroyed by travel restrictions, many landlords are also seeing their income evaporate overnight. Given that in the past few years real estate investors were strongly incentivized to load up on debt and hold over-leveraged bets, many landlords will soon find themselves insolvent and unable to make good on their mortgage payments. Before long, a sufficiently drawn-out rent strike will cascade through the economy and turn into a widespread consumer and commercial debt default. In other words, if things get bad enough for enough people, a short time from now we’ll have a real estate market crash and a financial crisis to compound our trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="15:1-15:662"&gt;Those of us watching the overheated real estate markets in Vancouver or Toronto may feel a twinge of schadenfreude. Short-term rental platforms have removed thousands of units from our rental markets, and we’re better off without them. There’s not a lot of sympathy to go around for the Airbnb speculator. Regardless, these are real problems that will prompt the government to act: Eventually, someone is going to end up getting a bailout. The issue for those of us on the left is who, exactly, will be on the receiving end, as modern real estate financing depends on a long chain that stretches from a tenant all the way down to mortgage securities markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="17:1-17:495"&gt;This crisis presents a unique opportunity. If and when the time to bailout the real estate market comes, we will be presented with a choice in how to use public funding. The default choice is to prop up the mortgage securities market  — as we’ve already begun to do — let smaller landlords hang out to dry, and sit back and watch as large, well-capitalized, corporations buy up their properties on the cheap. We’ll indirectly bailout the financial system and allow inequality to worsen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="19:1-19:59"&gt;Instead, we should nationalize landlords’ housing units.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="21:1-21:683"&gt;The bailout could work like this: any residential property owner can sell their units in exchange for their accumulated equity plus inflation. The provincial or federal government would assume their debts, and continue housing their tenants, if any. Existing tenants would avoid being evicted during this crisis, and units that are currently empty can be provided to tenants on social housing waiting lists. This would also guarantee the financial system, and allow scores of landlords to avoid fire-sales of their assets. More importantly, this could add thousands of sorely needed affordable social housing units to our housing mix, and begin to correct decades of policy mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="23:1-23:310"&gt;Social housing is an essential part of our social welfare system. Being homeless causes so much instability that it effectively locks you out of both the formal economy and many government services, as well as the labour market income needed to access  the vast majority of housing in Canada, which is private.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="25:1-25:247"&gt;The government used to understand this conundrum, and in the post-war era we began to significantly invest in the construction of social housing: From the mid-1960s to the mid-90s, social housing accounted for about 10 per cent of all new housing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="27:1-27:314"&gt;That changed in the early-to-mid 1990s with governments at the federal and provincial levels, which rapidly divested and ceased building and supporting social housing. For the last 25 years we’ve been starving the social housing sector, and watched as waiting lists lengthened and rates of homelessness exploded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="29:1-29:590"&gt;Tenants need to be protected from eviction, and to prevent them from going bankrupt by extension we must also help their landlords. But public money ought not go to private profit. By nationalizing the assets of soon-to-be insolvent landlords and Airbnb real estate speculators, we can ameliorate a costly market crash, prevent economic inequality from rapidly worsening, prevent more tenants from becoming homeless, take currently homeless people off the streets by housing them in now-empty short-term rental properties, and restore a crucially needed sector of our social welfare system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="31:1-31:72"&gt;The time to act might come sooner than you think. We should be prepared.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Actually, Rent Control is Great: Revisiting Ontario’s Experience, the Supply of Housing, and Security of Tenure</title>

&lt;p data-sourcepos="5:1-5:702"&gt;Rent controls are criticized for acting as a severe disincentive to new and existing rental construction. From 1992 to 2017, the province of Ontario exempted all new buildings from its rent control regime. What was the effect on rental construction in Ontario during that time period? Finding that rental construction continues to be depressed, this paper documents contemporary Canadian housing policy initiatives and investigates the theoretical and empirical record of rent controls in other jurisdictions. This paper then argues that rent controls’ most important aspect is their regulation of the provision of security of tenure – which should be seen as a right of tenants as well as homeowners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-sourcepos="41:1-41:172"&gt;In April 2017, the government of Ontario decided to extend rent control to every rental unit in the province, as opposed to just those in buildings constructed before 1991.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="43:1-43:492"&gt;Different jurisdictions have overlapping definitions of “rent control”. What Ontario engages in is described by some academics and regions as a tenancy rent control, or as rent stabilization. It works like this: once a year, a landlord can raise the monthly rent by a provincial guideline pegged to inflation, or inflation plus 3% if their costs have spiked or they made improvements to the unit. Between tenants, landlords are free to price rents at whatever the market will bear.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-ltb-2017" id="fnref-ltb-2017" data-footnote-ref&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="45:1-45:163"&gt;This prompted a lot of commentary, ranging from benign skepticism&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-mcgrath-skepticism" id="fnref-mcgrath-skepticism" data-footnote-ref&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to vigorous condemnation.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-mcfarland-vigorous" id="fnref-mcfarland-vigorous" data-footnote-ref&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The chorus sounded like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-sourcepos="47:1-47:850"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="47:3-47:850"&gt;Against all common sense, the province is handing its cities a poisoned chalice: it is textbook economics that price controls sharply reduce the value of new construction.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-gee-2017" id="fnref-gee-2017" data-footnote-ref&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;  Under rent control, the quantity and quality of available rental units will fall as developers are less incentivized to build or invest in rental properties — all of which exacerbates any price crunch.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-tal-2017" id="fnref-tal-2017" data-footnote-ref&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The fact is, rent control would largely help high-end renters in a high-end market, since most units built after the rent control exemption are condominiums. It’s tough to see how rent control would accomplish much except transferring money from unit owners to their tenants.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-selley" id="fnref-selley" data-footnote-ref&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Instead, the province should be tackling the root of the problem: the supply of new housing units in Toronto and elsewhere is not keeping up with demand.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-thesun" id="fnref-thesun" data-footnote-ref&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="49:1-49:520"&gt;As a casual observer and experienced tenant, these claims seemed a little counter-intuitive. Toronto is currently in the grips of a housing crisis. A speculative real estate bubble has priced out ownership for low- and middle-income people,&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-cbc-squeeze" id="fnref-cbc-squeeze" data-footnote-ref&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and it’s easy to find stories about sitting tenants seeing their rents jump by hundreds of dollars.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-cbc-martin" id="fnref-cbc-martin" data-footnote-ref&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-tgam-jaafari" id="fnref-tgam-jaafari" data-footnote-ref&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-mercer-2017" id="fnref-mercer-2017" data-footnote-ref&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Every time I have looked for housing, the uncertainty of living in an uncontrolled apartment weighed heavily on my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="51:1-51:579"&gt;When demand for rental units is high and vacancy rates are low, landlords have a lot of power over their tenants — and all the more if they can increase rents at will. The absence of controls allows the unscrupulous to evict tenants exercising their rights, and the eager to extract more for the same service they provided before. It seemed strange for so many critics to ignore what felt like the real problem at hand: the lack of security of tenure. Could rent controls really be that counterproductive? For that reason, I decided to learn as much as I could about the topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="53:1-53:577"&gt;This paper explores the mechanics and outcomes of rent control policies. First, I examine the empirical evidence of rent control’s impact on rental housing construction in Toronto and the province of Ontario over the past forty years. Then, I review the economics literature and explore and challenge the theoretical basis for rent controls’ poor reputation. Finally, I examine our shifting understanding of the relationship between tenants and landlords, and the history of Canadian housing policy to argue for the state’s role in ensuring the provision of security of tenure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 data-sourcepos="58:1-58:30"&gt;

&lt;p data-sourcepos="60:1-60:590"&gt;When we talk about rental supply, we typically distinguish between the “primary” rental market, where professional landlords operate purpose built rental buildings, and the “secondary” rental market, where individuals rent out their basement apartments or spare condominiums.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-toronto-2006" id="fnref-toronto-2006" data-footnote-ref&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; We typically favour primary rentals because professional, full-time landlords are more capable of absorbing maintenance costs and are far likelier to provide long-term accommodation. Condominium units have a tendency to get flipped, and basement apartments are often vacated for the owner’s own use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="62:1-62:224"&gt;We’re blessed that Ontario is a relatively well studied jurisdiction. In a widely cited&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-widely-cited" id="fnref-widely-cited" data-footnote-ref&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; paper written in 1988, Lawrence Smith looked at Ontario’s rental market in the aftermath of the province’s rent controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="66:1-66:570"&gt;According to Smith, the primary rental housing sector has been in a state of crisis for about forty years.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-smith-1983" id="fnref-smith-1983" data-footnote-ref&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Beginning in the 1970s, the construction of new private purpose-built rental buildings collapsed. If in 1969 Ontario had 27,543 new, unassisted rental building starts, by the mid 1980s under 5,000 were being built as private developers left the market.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-smith-1988" id="fnref-smith-1988" data-footnote-ref&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; At first their departure was compensated by government assisted housing starts, but before long the provincial and federal governments began to withdraw funding as well.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-toronto-2006" id="fnref-toronto-2006-2" data-footnote-ref&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="69:1-69:466"&gt;Around the same time primary rentals dried up, new tenant protection legislation was being introduced, and by 1975 rent controls were in effect throughout the province. In the beginning, rents were essentially fixed in nominal terms, which in a high inflation era meant their real values quickly declined. New construction was at first exempted, and then not; only by 1986 were the guidelines changed such that rent adjustments became tied to inflation.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-smith-1988" id="fnref-smith-1988-2" data-footnote-ref&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="71:1-71:533"&gt;Smith’s technical argument against controls goes something like this: rent control artificially lowers the income that landlords can expect to receive from rental properties. This depresses any motivation investors may have for responding to demand by creating new rental buildings. Meanwhile, lower rent costs relative to ownership encourage more people to stay in the rental market, which creates more demand for fewer units. A control imposed in response to unaffordable rents and low vacancy rates will therefore exacerbate both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="73:1-73:356"&gt;Rent controls don’t just affect new construction, and therefore new tenants; they can have stark effects on existing units as well. Faced with a control where increases in rent grow at a rate slower than the costs of maintaining the property, existing landlords are strongly encouraged to let their properties deteriorate, or convert them to condominiums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="75:1-75:408"&gt;Smith argued that all of the above occurred after the province instituted its 1975 rent controls. He found that real rents and capital values of rental units collapsed, and that Toronto lost 11% of its moderately priced rental housing stock through conversions, demolition, and eviction through renovation. By 1986, vacancy rates were an extremely low 0.1%, but the market was unable to add supply. To quote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-sourcepos="77:1-77:442"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="77:2-77:442"&gt;In a normally functioning, uncontrolled housing market a vacancy rate below the natural (or equilibrium) rate triggers an increase in real rents and real capital values. This in turn stimulates increased expenditures on the existing stock and increased new construction. Rent controls break this connection between low vacancies and large housing expenditures, and thereby impede the market adjustment necessary to satisfy the excess demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-sourcepos="79:1-79:4"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="79:2-79:4"&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-sourcepos="81:1-81:296"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="81:2-81:296"&gt;The timing and severity of the decline in rental housing starts, especially in government unassisted rental starts, and the contrast with the pattern of single detached, semi-detached and duplex starts suggest rent controls substantially reduced the volume of new rental construction in Ontario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-sourcepos="83:1-83:225"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="83:2-83:225"&gt;[Other factors such as less favourable demographics, rising interest rates, and increased tenant protection may have exacerbated the decline in rental starts, but rent controls appear to be the primary factor.] &lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-smith-1988" id="fnref-smith-1988-3" data-footnote-ref&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-sourcepos="96:1-96:149"&gt;Let’s take this for granted, then. Rent controls appear to be the primary factor. Smith’s paper was published some time ago. What has happened since?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="98:1-98:572"&gt;In 1992, the New Democratic government’s Rent Control Act limited the kind of capital expenditures landlords could recover via rent increases and once again exempted new rental housing from rent control for a period of 5 years.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-miron-1995" id="fnref-miron-1995" data-footnote-ref&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In 1998, the Progressive Conservative government initiated the most dramatic change since their introduction: capital expenditures could now be fully recovered, vacancy decontrol&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-vacancy-decontrol" id="fnref-vacancy-decontrol" data-footnote-ref&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; was introduced for existing units, and rents in new buildings were permanently deregulated.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-rent-control-city-report" id="fnref-rent-control-city-report" data-footnote-ref&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-smith-2003" id="fnref-smith-2003" data-footnote-ref&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="102:1-102:294"&gt;This means that for over twenty years&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-rta-2006" id="fnref-rta-2006" data-footnote-ref&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; tenants have lived in a regime where new construction lacked any kind of rent control. If rent controls by themselves are the main disincentive acting on the volume of new rental construction, how do we expect the market to have responded since?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="106:1-106:288"&gt;Any recent resident of Toronto can attest to a rapid pace of new construction. My assumption was that, starting from 1998, we should see a slow but steady increase in the rate of construction in new rental buildings and that they should eventually reach levels similar to those pre-1975.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="108:1-108:156"&gt;Compiling data provided by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), I was able to extend &lt;a href="#fref:fig1"&gt;Figure 1&lt;/a&gt; up to the present day:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="fref:fig2"&gt;
&lt;a href="/img/Ontario%20Housing%20Starts%201969-2016.png"&gt;&lt;img src="/img/Ontario%20Housing%20Starts%201969-2016.png" title="Ontario Housing Starts by Intended Market 1969-2016" style="max-width:100%;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Figure 2.&lt;/b&gt; Ontario housing starts by intended market 1969-2016. Data from 1987 onwards is restricted to areas with over 10,000 people, and therefore undercounts total starts.
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="117:1-117:300"&gt;During the 1969-1974 pre-rent control period for which we have data, there were on average 32,704 unassisted rental starts per year, or about 30% of total production. From 2009 to 2016, a period without any rent controls, Ontario averaged 5,147 new rental unit starts, or a mere 10% of total supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="119:1-119:356"&gt;If rent controls were the primary factor inhibiting new construction today, then surely we’d expect to see the opposite. Yet primary rental starts remain depressed.  Opponents of controls argue that developers continued to price in the risk of their reintroduction,&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-brescia-2005" id="fnref-brescia-2005" data-footnote-ref&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but judged over the course of almost a generation that argument is wanting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="121:1-121:542"&gt;One downside of Smith’s 1988 study is that it does not control for demographics, interest rates, recessions, etc. Rent controls could have caused record low vacancy rates by inducing higher demand – but 1986 was also when the majority of the baby-boom cohort hit the prime rental occupancy age range of 20-35.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-rental-demographics" id="fnref-rental-demographics" data-footnote-ref&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Adequately controlling for everything is no easy task: reviewing the literature, it’s a bit of an open question whether we possess the empirical data or theoretical capacity to do so properly.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-lind-2003-note" id="fnref-lind-2003-note" data-footnote-ref&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="127:1-127:317"&gt;It’s unsatisfying to merely note that the existing hypothesis doesn’t fit new data. Ideally, we should be able to supply our own causal narrative. Why have developers built fewer units than they did during a period of harsh rent control? For that matter, why aren’t they building them like they used to in the 1960s?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="129:1-129:171"&gt;What else could be happening? While researching housing policy and statistics, I was able to identify two other big shifts that significantly impacted our housing supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-sourcepos="131:1-131:31"&gt;
&lt;a id="the-rise-of-the-condominium" class="anchor" href="#the-rise-of-the-condominium" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The rise of the condominium&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="134:1-134:270"&gt;The first shift happened in 1967, when Ontario legalized condominiums and created a new form of property ownership – thereby substantially altering the economics behind multi-residential buildings. Since then, condominiums have dominated multi-residential construction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="136:1-136:79"&gt;This trend stands out pretty clearly when condominiums are compared to rentals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="fref:fig3"&gt;
&lt;a href="/img/Ontario%20Housing%20Starts%201969-2016%20With%20Condos.png"&gt;&lt;img src="/img/Ontario%20Housing%20Starts%201969-2016%20With%20Condos.png" title="Ontario Housing Starts by Intended Market and Condos 1969-2016" style="max-width:100%;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Figure 3.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="#fref:fig2"&gt;Figure 2&lt;/a&gt;, but distinguishing condos from single, detached and other housing.
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="146:1-146:585"&gt;On second thought, I wondered whether looking at this data at a regional level might be misleading, since different sub-regional housing markets have differing economic conditions. As you can see from the housing mix in &lt;a href="#fref:fig3"&gt;Figure 3&lt;/a&gt;, Ontario was and still is aggressively subdividing and sprawling. With an abundance of available freehold land it’s possible that, looking at province-wide data, we might understate the impact of condominiums. How would this look like in an already built-up area where by and large higher density developments are the only option?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="148:1-148:93"&gt;For that reason, I dug up and plotted recent and historical data from Toronto:&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-note-digging" id="fnref-note-digging" data-footnote-ref&gt;26&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="fref:fig4"&gt;
&lt;a href="/img/Toronto%20Housing%20Completions%201981-2016.png"&gt;&lt;img src="/img/Toronto%20Housing%20Completions%201981-2016.png" title="City of Toronto Housing Completions by Intended Market 1981-2016" style="max-width:100%;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Figure 4.&lt;/b&gt; City of Toronto housing completions by intended market 1981-2016. Note that this graph measures completions, as opposed to starts, and is therefore not directly comparable to &lt;a href="#fref:fig3"&gt;Figure 3&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="159:1-159:469"&gt;Prior to the Condominium Act, apartment buildings could only be rented out or sold in their entirety. Now, for the first time, title could be given to each individual unit, greatly increasing the allowed density of privately owned housing. Condominiums immediately began to crowd out rental building investment: the first condominium in Ontario was originally constructed as a rental and was converted to a condominium soon after the law came into effect.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-hanes-2008" id="fnref-hanes-2008" data-footnote-ref&gt;27&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="161:1-161:408"&gt;Why is that so? In 2012, Jill Black wrote a great research paper regarding the financing and economics of multi-residential housing development. She explores the incentives property developers act on and the disincentives they suffer as they choose projects to work on, and it’s well worth a read. According to her research, building to rent is riskier and less profitable than building to sell.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-black-2012" id="fnref-black-2012" data-footnote-ref&gt;28&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="163:1-163:481"&gt;Developers find building for the ownership market more attractive because with condominium projects construction doesn’t begin until a majority of units are pre-sold to qualified buyers. This early-on cash stream reduces the amount of necessary debt, lowers interest repayment costs, and makes it easier to obtain financing. By the time the condominium units are occupied, the developer has realized their returns and freed up their equity for use in other projects.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-black-2012-2" id="fnref-black-2012-2" data-footnote-ref&gt;29&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="165:1-165:698"&gt;In contrast, a rental building doesn’t generate income until it’s completed and therefore it’s harder to assess and demonstrate its financial feasibility. This means more equity is needed to obtain more expensive, CMHC insured, financing – equity which won’t be recouped for years or decades.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-black-2012-2" id="fnref-black-2012-2-2" data-footnote-ref&gt;29&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Land values, which account for 15-30% of the cost, are thus driven by the more profitable condominium projects.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-pomeroy-2001" id="fnref-pomeroy-2001" data-footnote-ref&gt;30&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In a way, the development of condominiums in desirable locations can lead to a kind of “Dutch disease”, whereby the more profitable projects support an increase in costs and prices that make other, lower margin, projects unprofitable by comparison.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-lind-2003-2" id="fnref-lind-2003-2" data-footnote-ref&gt;31&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="169:1-169:483"&gt;Finally, registering as a condominium allows for a more favourable tax treatment, since multi-residential properties are discriminated against by both our sales tax regime&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-lampert-2016-note" id="fnref-lampert-2016-note" data-footnote-ref&gt;32&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and by municipal property tax rates which are set higher than ownership housing.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-hswg-2001" id="fnref-hswg-2001" data-footnote-ref&gt;33&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The average tenant in Ontario pays twice the property tax rate of a homeowner, which for a hypothetical new rental building in Toronto works out to over $200 a month in rent per tenant.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-frpo-2015" id="fnref-frpo-2015" data-footnote-ref&gt;34&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="173:1-173:676"&gt;However, condominiums didn’t just change supply incentives. They also changed demand. Ownership has several advantages compared to renting: a homeowner has more control over their surroundings, an easier time accumulating wealth, enjoys tax benefits (which I will soon discuss), and so on. By expanding the options for ownership, condominiums remove the highest income earners from the rental market. As a consequence, “there has been a significant fall in the demand for private renting amongst those able to pay the rents needed to generate new construction of private rented housing” and renting has increasingly become the domain of people with lower incomes.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-crook-1998" id="fnref-crook-1998" data-footnote-ref&gt;36&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="175:1-175:461"&gt;All of this conspires to make profit margins in the multi-residential investment market very narrow. What might be a suitable rate of return for an insurance company looking to operate a rental building is often insufficient for a developer to build a new one.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-hswg-2001" id="fnref-hswg-2001-2" data-footnote-ref&gt;33&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Small shifts in financing terms, land values, costs incurred due to delays in the regulatory planning process, and taxation can have a serious impact on the feasibility of a given project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="177:1-177:205"&gt;The notion that condominiums crowded out rental investment is compelling, but by itself doesn’t really exculpate rent controls. What if controls are just enough of a disincentive to shift the equilibrium?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-sourcepos="179:1-179:39"&gt;
&lt;a id="the-end-of-real-estate-tax-shelters" class="anchor" href="#the-end-of-real-estate-tax-shelters" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The end of real estate tax shelters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="181:1-181:333"&gt;The other significant event occurred in 1972, when the federal government overhauled the income tax system. Seeking to make taxation more equitable, close loopholes and reorient which industries it incentivized,&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-budget-1971" id="fnref-budget-1971" data-footnote-ref&gt;37&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; starting in 1972 and throughout the 1970s and 80s, the federal government implemented a series of reforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="183:1-183:721"&gt;For the first time, the government began to tax capital gains – with the notable exception of the sale of a primary residence. The government changed the tax treatment of losses due to capital cost allowances, the rate at which capital costs can be depreciated, and removed the ability to pool rental buildings and defer the recapture of depreciation upon the sale of a property. It also prevented investors from outside the real estate business from claiming capital cost deductions or offsetting income via rental losses, and it altered how and which “soft” construction costs like architect fees, building permits, etc, can be deducted,&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-hswg-2001" id="fnref-hswg-2001-3" data-footnote-ref&gt;33&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; amongst other changes.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-note-on-taxes" id="fnref-note-on-taxes" data-footnote-ref&gt;38&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-clayton-1998" id="fnref-clayton-1998" data-footnote-ref&gt;39&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-miron-1995" id="fnref-miron-1995-2" data-footnote-ref&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="187:1-187:947"&gt;In practical terms, this meant that purpose-built rental buildings became a far less attractive investment class, while homeownership became far more attractive. Taxing all capital gains except primary residences, in addition to the variety of demand and supply side incentives and subsidies being offered at the time, is a considerable enticement for diverting money into homeownership. With regard to rentals, being able to depreciate a building tax-wise at a faster rate than its actual economic depreciation can have a large impact on after-tax returns.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-hswg-2001" id="fnref-hswg-2001-4" data-footnote-ref&gt;33&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Rental buildings become more profitable over time, as inflation and debt repayment lowers ongoing operating costs; prior to these reforms, high-earning professionals could use losses generated by rental properties to offset their higher marginal tax rates, and they could use liberal capital cost allowance rates to defer income tax until they sold their property.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-miron-1995" id="fnref-miron-1995-3" data-footnote-ref&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="189:1-189:561"&gt;Additionally, in 1991 the Goods and Services Tax was introduced (and later, harmonized in most provinces), which increased the sales tax burden on new construction by almost 70%.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-enemark-2017" id="fnref-enemark-2017" data-footnote-ref&gt;40&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Whereas before only the building materials used in the construction of a rental building had a sales tax, now the full value of the building was subject to a 7% charge (though, lower today).&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-clayton-1998-2" id="fnref-clayton-1998-2" data-footnote-ref&gt;41&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Renters don’t pay GST/HST on their rent, which means that developers are stuck with input credits they can’t use, thereby “stranding” tax costs.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-lampert-2016" id="fnref-lampert-2016-2" data-footnote-ref&gt;35&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="191:1-191:877"&gt;Marion Steele, writing in 1993, argued that these reforms, coupled with contemporary macro economic conditions, incentivized small scale landlording. The 1970s and 1980s featured high inflation and unprecedented housing price booms, which made expected capitals gains “the dominating motivation of investors”. Capital gains, in turn, are more valuable to high-income individuals than they are to corporations, whose marginal tax rates are lower.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-steele-1993" id="fnref-steele-1993" data-footnote-ref&gt;42&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Before, developers built large scale schemes for their own investment, and smaller schemes for sale to high-income individuals or their syndicates. But now these tax changes prompted developers to leave the industry,&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-crook-1998-2" id="fnref-crook-1998-2" data-footnote-ref&gt;43&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and drew investors to dwelling structures that were easier to sell and whose conversion to ownership tenure was unrestricted: houses, duplexes, etc, and condominium units.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-steele-1993" id="fnref-steele-1993-2" data-footnote-ref&gt;42&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="193:1-193:279"&gt;These changes were made with little, if any, regard for their adverse consequences for our housing policy goals,&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-clayton-1998" id="fnref-clayton-1998-2" data-footnote-ref&gt;39&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and given that the “Great Apartment Boom” of the 1960s ended shortly thereafter suggests that the effect of these changes was substantial.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-miron-1995" id="fnref-miron-1995-4" data-footnote-ref&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Figure 5.&lt;/b&gt; Canada housing starts by structure type 1951-2001. Note that these categories describe physical structures, i.e. "apartment" includes both duplexes, triplexes, etc and the large towers we today find synonymous with condominiums. We built more (almost entirely rental) apartment buildings in 1968 than we built (mostly condominiums) apartment buildings in 2001 (or 2016, for that matter).
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="202:1-202:531"&gt;Various federal Liberal governments recognized there were consequences from changing the Income Tax Act and tried to do something about it. The Multi-Unit Residential Building incentive (1974-1979, 1981) re-enabled the use of rental investment as a tax shelter. The Assisted Rental Program (1974-1979, 1981) gave subsidized mortgages to developers in exchange for below-market rents. The Canada Rental Supply Program (1981-1984) provided interest-free loans for up to fifteen years. The list goes on.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-goldberg-1985" id="fnref-goldberg-1985" data-footnote-ref&gt;44&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-suttor-2009" id="fnref-suttor-2009" data-footnote-ref&gt;45&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="204:1-204:544"&gt;Besides the decline in rental housing starts, we have one other piece of evidence: the United States’ current tax regime as applied to rental buildings is broadly similar to how we did things pre-1972.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-clayton-1998-3" id="fnref-clayton-1998-3" data-footnote-ref&gt;46&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Though we can’t compare them directly – Canada and the US are very different places – consider the example of Seattle and Vancouver. While Vancouver is experiencing a furious condominium boom, taking up to 60% of housing starts, the vast majority of new units in Seattle are apartment buildings.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-nota-bene" id="fnref-nota-bene" data-footnote-ref&gt;47&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-morales-2017" id="fnref-morales-2017" data-footnote-ref&gt;48&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-sourcepos="208:1-208:13"&gt;
&lt;a id="in-review" class="anchor" href="#in-review" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;In review&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="210:1-210:297"&gt;Commentators argue that rent controls are harmful because they remove new primary rental supply from the market, and therefore exacerbate the problem of low vacancies. In 1992, the province exempted new construction from rent controls for five years, and in 1998 that exemption was made permanent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="212:1-212:447"&gt;Yet investment in units intended for the rental market continues to be depressed. Instead, I argue that two other concurrent policy changes can better explain this trend. The first was the legalization of condominiums, which shifted the supply and demand incentives in multi-residential buildings and crowded out investment in rental buildings. The second were income and sales tax reforms, which has reduced the profitability of rental buildings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="214:1-214:417"&gt;Of course, there are many other factors and angles we haven’t looked at. We have not controlled for the huge impacts of fluctuating interest rates, demographic trends, land prices, and so on. Tenants are further discriminated by municipal property taxes and exclusionary zoning restrictions. Yet given the timing of these changes, it seems fair to say that rent controls are not the main disincentive operating today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="216:1-216:344"&gt;But if Ontario’s rent controls probably did not impact the supply of new housing, what else can we say about them? How does this evidence fit into the theoretical basis behind most economists’ criticism of rent controls? What evidence do we have from other jurisdictions? What other criticisms are misguided — and which ones are well founded?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-sourcepos="224:1-224:220"&gt;The point of this paper isn’t to say that price controls are a paragon of virtue, but instead to critically examine the received wisdom: the picture is rather murkier than that shown in in the standard textbook analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="226:1-226:468"&gt;One major problem with this discussion is that there are actually many qualitatively different kinds of rent controls, which different regions have experimented with over different periods of time. When designing a control, we can decide when and how prices increase, whether they track inflation or another indicator, whether capital expenditures can be recovered, at what rate vacant units can reset to what the market will bear (if at all), and so on.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-nota-bene-2" id="fnref-nota-bene-2" data-footnote-ref&gt;49&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="230:1-230:546"&gt;Richard Arnott, in a widely read paper from 1995, broadly categorizes rent control policy into two distinct phases.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-arnott-original" id="fnref-arnott-original" data-footnote-ref&gt;50&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The first wave, or generation, of controls were enacted around World War II and they imposed nominal rent freezes tied to individual units. In a planned war economy that lacked much in the way of private housing construction, this made a certain amount of sense; but afterwards most regions dismantled their controls and only New York City (and some European cities) maintained that wartime policy.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-arnott-1995" id="fnref-arnott-1995" data-footnote-ref&gt;51&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="234:1-234:624"&gt;The second generation began in the 1970s as rent control ordinances were passed in Boston, Los Angeles, San Francisco and in a variety of towns in California, Massachussetts, New Jersey, New York, etc. The structure of Canadian governance saw these policies accumulate at the provincial level, and during this period ten provinces also enacted rent controls (though most have since abandoned them). These policies “differed significantly from the first-generation rent control programs” and usually allowed automatic increases in rent, the passing through of additional costs, and other like-minded provisions.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-arnott-1995" id="fnref-arnott-1995-2" data-footnote-ref&gt;51&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="236:1-236:618"&gt;Separating controls into “hard” and “soft” is not especially useful, though. Hans Lind, writing in 2001, defined five distinct functional types of rent control. In his view, regulations can protect sitting tenants from being charged above-market rents (type A), or from increases in rent unattached to increases in costs (type B). Alternatively, regulations can instead bind to units and prevent landlords anywhere from charging above-market rents (type C), prevent rapid inflation by smoothing increases (type D) or, finally, prevent rents from ever reaching actual market prices (type E).&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-note-on-lind" id="fnref-note-on-lind" data-footnote-ref&gt;52&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-lind-2001" id="fnref-lind-2001" data-footnote-ref&gt;53&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="240:1-240:730"&gt;The takeaway here is that when we talk about regulations, we have to be specific since their goals, mechanisms and therefore impacts are going to be different. New York City’s rent controls, which Lind identifies as an extreme version of a type E control,&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-lind-2001" id="fnref-lind-2001-2" data-footnote-ref&gt;53&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; are the most famous and well studied example, and consequently critics are quick to conflate all rent regulation with the kind experienced there.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-widely-cited-2" id="fnref-widely-cited-2" data-footnote-ref&gt;54&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; That tendency is unfortunate, since in doing so they perform a sleight of hand: New York City’s complex and overlapping rent regulations were enacted at different points of time,&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-nycrgb-2016-note" id="fnref-nycrgb-2016-note" data-footnote-ref&gt;55&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and therefore its experience is idiosyncratic and unlikely to be directly applicable to other cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="246:1-246:607"&gt;Of course, they’re not wrong to criticize nominal rent freezes. Obviously, a control regime that over time lowers real income below that of real expenditures is a &lt;em&gt;bad idea&lt;/em&gt;. It transforms rental properties into endless money pits. It’s fine, and likely necessary, to subsidize some aspects of how we produce or provide housing units in order to achieve our policy goals – but it’s unreasonable to expect that subsidy to be provided to the exclusive detriment of individual landlords. If investors wish to transfer their wealth to tenants they don’t need to go through the trouble of erecting a building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="248:1-248:128"&gt;But that’s a false choice. We’re not limited to choosing between an unfettered market and a ruinously restrictive price control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-sourcepos="250:1-250:62"&gt;
&lt;a id="in-a-competitive-market-prices-dont-increase-arbitrarily" class="anchor" href="#in-a-competitive-market-prices-dont-increase-arbitrarily" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;In a competitive market, prices don’t increase arbitrarily&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="252:1-252:554"&gt;When economists discuss losses in efficiency, allocation and welfare, they’re comparing the real world with an idealized “perfectly competitive” market where landlords compete to produce homogeneous housing units, there are no externalities, every actor possesses perfect information, and so on. In this view, a landlord faced with increased demand is free to increase prices and profits accordingly. Abnormally high profits, though, attract other potential landlords who by virtue of adding to the supply of apartments will then drive down their prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="254:1-254:631"&gt;Given a perfect market, any sketch on a napkin will show that if prices are not allowed to rise with demand then new entrants will stay put, supply will not increase, and shortages will follow. However, given perfect competition, the market prices any landlord can fetch will over the long run equal their marginal cost, i.e. the amortized cost of building and operating a housing unit plus the landlord’s opportunity cost. Put another way, in a &lt;em&gt;well functioning market&lt;/em&gt; it’s more or less unreasonable to expect that the rents any given landlord is able to extract will grow much faster than costs and inflation.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-arnott-monopoly" id="fnref-arnott-monopoly" data-footnote-ref&gt;58&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="258:1-258:726"&gt;The implication here is that while absolute price ceilings can be and are harmful, there is no obvious reason why price &lt;em&gt;smoothing&lt;/em&gt; such that increases match but do not exceed costs should have a strong effect on the incentive to create new rental housing.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-arnott-2003-note" id="fnref-arnott-2003-note" data-footnote-ref&gt;59&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Other economists have reached this conclusion. Writing in 2001, Alastair McFarlane developed an econometric model of rent stabilization and concluded that “because allowing fully flexible base rents permits landlords to capture all of the advantages of a rent growth control, neither the timing nor the density of development will be affected by rent stabilization”, though landlords are incentivized to redevelop sooner than later.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-macfarlane-2001" id="fnref-macfarlane-2001" data-footnote-ref&gt;60&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="262:1-262:458"&gt;Trivially, investment in multi-residential buildings is a function of one’s cost of equity, cost of financing and net operating income; developers may invest in a project expecting significant growth in their net operating income, but in a competitive market that is a rather risky assumption. Therefore, even in the absence of rent controls, projects by and large must be cashflow positive given rents available immediately post-construction.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-black-2012-4" id="fnref-black-2012-4" data-footnote-ref&gt;62&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="264:1-264:675"&gt;As far as new supply is concerned, we can therefore conceive of a non-harmful rent control: if prices increase with costs and inflation, landlord cashflows should largely be unaffected. It’s easy to see why: a cost-adjusted tenancy rent control primarily impacts only one area of the development process: the initial lease up of an empty building.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-tait-2017" id="fnref-tait-2017" data-footnote-ref&gt;63&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Given the long-term nature of multi-residential investment, and provided with the ability to adjust for initial mistakes, over the long run the impact on their finances should be reasonable if not minimal – and their business model can be satisfied so long as cashflows keep up with costs and capital expenditures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="266:1-266:97"&gt;Consider GWL Realty Advisors, whose president Paul Finkbeiner was quoted in the &lt;em&gt;Financial Post&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-sourcepos="269:1-269:310"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="269:4-269:310"&gt;“We believe there is a strong demand for rental apartments and this property will lease up over time,” Finkbeiner said about his Livmore project, […] “Apartments provide good long-term returns and very low vacancy levels, it’s just one of the best assets classes from a stability point of view.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-sourcepos="271:1-271:5"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="271:3-271:5"&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-sourcepos="273:1-273:354"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="273:3-273:354"&gt;GWL seems to think it can work within the new provincial rules. “As a developer, we are building something that will last for 25-50 years that works for tenants,” said Finkbeiner. “We want long-term renters which is also consistent with our investors that are long-term in nature. These buildings go to pay pensions and people’s investments.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-sourcepos="275:1-275:166"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="275:3-275:166"&gt;He noted Ontario still allows rents to be raised to market level once a tenant leaves a unit and capital improvements to buildings can also be passed on to tenants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-sourcepos="277:1-277:210"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="277:3-277:210"&gt;“All we want is a fair rent for our apartments, we do not want above guidelines. We have been able to work within rent controls and still deliver a good product for our investors and tenants,”&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-marr-2017" id="fnref-marr-2017" data-footnote-ref&gt;64&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 data-sourcepos="279:1-279:47"&gt;
&lt;a id="evidence-on-supply-from-other-jurisdictions" class="anchor" href="#evidence-on-supply-from-other-jurisdictions" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Evidence on supply from other jurisdictions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="281:1-281:288"&gt;Recall that Ontario’s current rent control regime pegs rents to inflation, does not control rents between tenants, and allows cost pass through. Lind categorized it as a type B control,&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-lind-2001" id="fnref-lind-2001-3" data-footnote-ref&gt;53&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and elsewhere it is variously called a kind of tenancy rent control or rent stabilization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="283:1-283:359"&gt;We saw earlier that though Ontario’s previous rent control regimes may have been harmful, they were unlikely to be the main disincentives acting on supply since 1998, when vacancies were decontrolled and new construction was exempted entirely. Since we need to compare apples-to-apples, what other evidence can we draw for the impacts of type B rent controls?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="285:1-285:576"&gt;Consider Manitoba, whose regulation scheme is broadly similar&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-note-on-mb" id="fnref-note-on-mb" data-footnote-ref&gt;65&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and has regulated rents since roughly 1976. Hugh Grant, writing in 2011, argues that there is no evidence that Manitoba’s rent regulation program had a negative effect on the supply of new, or maintenance of existing, rental properties. Manitoba at the time was experiencing a low vacancy rate, which Grant attributed to a rapid influx of immigration, and a relatively inelastic supply due to large planning-to-completion time lags and uncertainty about future rates of population growth.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-grant-2011" id="fnref-grant-2011" data-footnote-ref&gt;66&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="289:1-289:643"&gt;In New Jersey, over one hundred municipalities have enacted their own rent controls. Each city implemented their regulation differently, but by and large they all permit automatic increases, passing on capital improvements, etc; almost half also engage in vacancy decontrol. In 2015, Joshua Ambrosius et al used the 2010 United States Census and compared the regulated cities with unregulated cities. They found that, once they controlled for other factors, New Jersey rent control policies had no statistical impact on rental quality, rental supply, property appreciation or foreclosure rates in the cities that enacted them.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-ambrosius-2015" id="fnref-ambrosius-2015" data-footnote-ref&gt;67&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="291:1-291:346"&gt;In fact, tenancy rent controls seem to barely control rents at all. Earlier this year, Graham Haines analyzed Ontario’s rent regulations and developed a model that estimated that “the discounted cumulative income earned by the rent controlled building was between 98.5% and 99.0% of that earned by the non-rent controlled building”.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-haines-2017" id="fnref-haines-2017" data-footnote-ref&gt;68&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="293:1-293:426"&gt;This finding is corroborated by both the Manitoba and the New Jersey study cited above. In New Jersey, median rents in rent controlled cities were found to be roughly the same as rents in non-controlled cities.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-ambrosius-2015-2" id="fnref-ambrosius-2015-2" data-footnote-ref&gt;69&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In Manitoba, Grant argues “there is no evidence that rent regulations have restricted rents below what would prevail in a perfectly-competitive market under equilibrium conditions”.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-grant-2011-2" id="fnref-grant-2011-2" data-footnote-ref&gt;70&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="295:1-295:896"&gt;Though they do not quite confirm to my criteria above, two other studies are worth mentioning. Frank Denton et al, in a 1993 report commissioned by the CMHC, developed an econometric model and conducted an extensive empirical investigation of the impact of rent controls on Canadian housing markets. They concluded that “there is no evidence that controls influence the long-run rate of increase of rents”, nor did they impact housing starts or maintenance though they may lower vacancy rates.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-denton-1993-note" id="fnref-denton-1993-note" data-footnote-ref&gt;71&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-denton-1993" id="fnref-denton-1993" data-footnote-ref&gt;72&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Celia Lazzarin analyzed rent regulations in British Columbia from 1974 to 1984 for her 1990 master’s thesis. She found that basically there were too many confounding variables (demographics, unemployment, interest and inflation rates, migration, etc) to attribute the declines in Vancouver’s rental supply solely to rent controls.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-lazzarin-1990-note" id="fnref-lazzarin-1990-note" data-footnote-ref&gt;73&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-lazzarin-1990" id="fnref-lazzarin-1990" data-footnote-ref&gt;74&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-sourcepos="301:1-301:60"&gt;
&lt;a id="controls-probably-incentivize-tenure-conversions-though" class="anchor" href="#controls-probably-incentivize-tenure-conversions-though" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Controls probably incentivize tenure conversions, though&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="303:1-303:162"&gt;There is one noticeable disadvantage to a tenancy rent control: in tight markets the delta between long term tenant rates and market rates can grow rather large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="305:1-305:269"&gt;Because rents reset between tenants, landlords therefore may try to select for shorter term tenancies (i.e. by preferring students over families) and building smaller units. Lawrence Smith wrote about this in 2003, as well as Richard Arnott.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-smith-2003" id="fnref-smith-2003-2" data-footnote-ref&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-arnott-2003" id="fnref-arnott-2003-2" data-footnote-ref&gt;61&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="307:1-307:385"&gt;Keeping some rents below market prices has another detrimental effect: it encourages property owners to economically evict their tenants via renovations or to convert to unregulated forms of tenure. At the beginning of this paper, I reviewed Lawrence Smith’s 1988 paper which mentions this for Toronto, and earlier I cited McFarlane (2001). I’ve chosen to highlight three other papers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="309:1-309:491"&gt;Writing in 2017, Martine August documented the financialization of multi family residential properties in Toronto. Aided by the deregulation of capital markets, the end of Canadian social housing provision and historically low interest rates, private equity funds and real estate investment trusts have been buying up aging rental properties – with the explicitly stated purpose of turfing their existing low-income populations in order to renovate and gentrify their units.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-august-2017" id="fnref-august-2017" data-footnote-ref&gt;75&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="311:1-311:295"&gt;David Sims, writing in 2007, examined what happened after Massachusetts ended rent controls in 1994. He argues that units in previously controlled areas became 6 to 7 percentage points more likely to be rented out (i.e. that units were kept from the rental market).&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-sims-2007-note" id="fnref-sims-2007-note" data-footnote-ref&gt;76&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-sims-2007" id="fnref-sims-2007" data-footnote-ref&gt;77&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="315:1-315:585"&gt;Rebecca Diamond et al, in a paper published in 2017, leveraged a uniquely rich dataset. In 1994, the city of San Francisco extended its rent regulation to buildings with 4 or fewer rental units built before 1980 (about 30% of the rental stock). Combining a private data provider with property records, they were able to follow individual San Francisco tenants occupying regulated and unregulated housing units from 1994 to the present day. They found “that rent-controlled buildings were almost 10 percent more likely to convert to a condominium or a Tenancy in Common”.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-diamond-2017" id="fnref-diamond-2017" data-footnote-ref&gt;78&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="317:1-317:450"&gt;There is some reason to doubt these numbers prima facie, since converted housing units remain part of the housing stock – and a large percentage of condominiums are rented out to tenants without this necessarily being reflected in most housing data sources (though it seems that Diamond’s dataset mostly controls for this). It may be more accurate to say that primary rental units are being converted to ownership &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the secondary rental market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="319:1-319:507"&gt;In addition, California’s Ellis Act creates a relatively permissive environment for conversions. This is in contrast with Massachusetts, where Sims found that “rent decontrol is associated with an 8 percentage point increase in the probability of a unit being a condominium”, presumably since conversion restrictions were lifted alongside controls.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-sims-2007" id="fnref-sims-2007-2" data-footnote-ref&gt;77&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Nevertheless, it seems fair to conclude that keeping units below market rates exacerbates the incentive towards selling them or redeveloping them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="321:1-321:677"&gt;I think it is important to distinguish between conversion to ownership tenure and “renovictions”. Reading these papers I can’t help but think that the actual problem with condominium conversions has more to do with rising land values and the lack of new supply. That regular, continuous growth in market rates makes conversions attractive is not surprising. San Francisco’s property values have appreciated by 550% over the last thirty years,&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-mclaughlin-2016" id="fnref-mclaughlin-2016" data-footnote-ref&gt;79&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and it rather famously doesn’t build much in the way of new housing despite creating lots of well paid jobs.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-torres-2017" id="fnref-torres-2017" data-footnote-ref&gt;80&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; As seen in Massachusetts, condominium conversions can likely be regulated or disincentivized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="323:1-323:453"&gt;With regard to “renovictions”, I think we can ameliorate these conditions by moderately controlling vacancies, paired with a temporary exemption for new construction. If inter-tenancy rent increases are restricted by 10% or even 5% over inflation we reduce the incentive for high tenancy turnover and smooth rapid price increases across the market,&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-august-note" id="fnref-august-note" data-footnote-ref&gt;81&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; while preserving the normal incentive structures and business models previously described.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-sourcepos="327:1-327:35"&gt;
&lt;a id="affordability-is-about-the-land" class="anchor" href="#affordability-is-about-the-land" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Affordability is about the land&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="329:1-329:512"&gt;The essential observation here is that rent controls cause a decline in rentals not because they are rendered unprofitable or unsustainable, but because they are crowded out by ownership housing and other, more profitable uses. Today’s land prices set the floor on the rent tomorrow’s new supply needs to extract, and so it seems that when we talk about letting rent prices float to market rates, we imply that landlords deserve to capture the growth in value immediately rather than just through capital gains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="331:1-331:489"&gt;To the extent that increases in land values in certain cities are a function of inelastic supply, capital markets and low interest rates, that seems like a strange reason to support a transfer from tenants to landlords. In fact, allowing landlords to arbitrarily increase prices and extract value gains immediately likely incentivizes existing investors to &lt;em&gt;prefer&lt;/em&gt; a regime of supply inelasticity – since no new investment or activity is necessary from their behalf to reap the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="333:1-333:534"&gt;Ultimately, our housing crisis is a matter of income: tenants with low incomes have an &lt;em&gt;income&lt;/em&gt; problem, not a housing problem.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-hswg-final" id="fnref-hswg-final" data-footnote-ref&gt;82&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-brescia-2005-3" id="fnref-brescia-2005-3" data-footnote-ref&gt;83&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Land prices and other costs, driven by restrictive land use policies and the speculative bubble, have grown faster than tenant incomes and pushed financial recovery rents beyond what most of the rental population can afford or finds reasonable. While land prices continue to grow above inflation or wages, maintaining affordable housing stock will continue to be a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="335:2-335:479"&gt;In the absence of subsidies, the private sector is unlikely to build new rental housing for the low end of the market. Though the profitability of building modest cost ownership housing in large volumes can approach that of smaller quantities of high-end ownership housing, the same is not true for affordable rentals. It costs only slightly less to build an affordable rental, compared to building high end, but the resulting income stream is substantially smaller.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-hswg-2001" id="fnref-hswg-2001-5" data-footnote-ref&gt;33&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="337:1-337:708"&gt;Relatively affordable privately developed housing, then, occurs because as inflation and mortgage payments decrease carrying costs over time, the rent necessary to carry a rental investment decreases. And, through a process called filtering, new high-end housing creates vacancies lower in the chain as people move on up to occupy new supply. In theory, as the existing housing stock ages and deteriorates, people with higher incomes will tend to prefer newer, higher quality housing.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-brescia-2005-2" id="fnref-brescia-2005-2" data-footnote-ref&gt;84&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In practice, as housing preferences change and formerly ‘downtrodden’ areas become trendy, the filtering chain can get interrupted as higher-income people renovate and move into formerly lower-income areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-sourcepos="341:1-341:282"&gt;Commentators criticizing rent controls often point to New York City as a negative example, but that city’s experience is rather idiosyncratic. The design and implementation of rent controls varies so much that we must be careful and specific when making comparing different regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="343:1-343:585"&gt;Price controls are bad in so far that they render the production of goods and services untenable: absent subsidies, a landlord must be able to recoup her investment from the rent she extracts from her tenants. Conversely, as long as landlords can recover increases in their costs over time, their business models should be unaffected. While first generation controls were likely to be as harmful as described, there is no theoretical reason why a well-designed rent control should disincentivize new construction. This outcome is confirmed by several theoretical and empirical studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="345:1-345:355"&gt;However, a well-designed rent control allows landlords to pass through capital expenditures and somewhat incentivizes renovations, and therefore does not directly help with gentrification. A well-designed rent control does not disincentivize new supply but it doesn’t ease supply inelasticity either – and therefore by itself cannot ensure affordability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="347:1-347:117"&gt;What &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; rent controls good for, then? That a regulation is relatively neutral does not justify its implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-sourcepos="353:1-353:294"&gt;The economics literature on rent controls has much to say about efficient allocation, property values, maintenance and the supply and demand for rental housing, but unfortunately economists and other commentators rarely seem to have anything to say about security of tenure.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-jenkins-2009-note" id="fnref-jenkins-2009-note" data-footnote-ref&gt;85&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="357:1-357:100"&gt;The omission is glaring. In a 2003 paper reviewing tenancy rent controls, Richard Arnott noted that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-sourcepos="359:1-359:648"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="359:3-359:648"&gt;Almost all economists lead financially secure lives and were raised by parents who emphasized responsibility and self-discipline. They have little or no personal experience with the insecurity that is ever-present in the lives of the less advantaged—those from dysfunctional families, those not raised to middle-class values, and the less able—who tend to live from one paycheck to the next. Not surprisingly, therefore, most economists ignore or underemphasise the importance of security of tenure in rental housing, even though it is consistently second only to affordability on the list of concerns raised by tenant groups.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-arnott-2003-2" id="fnref-arnott-2003-2" data-footnote-ref&gt;87&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="361:1-361:573"&gt;Security of tenure is the idea that you have the right to occupy your home and be protected from being forced to leave against your will. By way of contrast, a homeowner’s right to security of tenure is usually taken for granted. So long as they’re current on mortgage payments (if any), taxes, etc, a homeowner is protected from involuntary eviction. That security is not absolute, of course: they may be expropriated or rising interest rates may render them unable to afford their home, but by and large “they cannot be forced out at the whim of someone else”.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-yee-1989" id="fnref-yee-1989" data-footnote-ref&gt;88&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="363:1-363:565"&gt;By default, in most common law jurisdictions tenants do not have this security. They may be denied a renewal of their lease, they may be subject to seizure by landlords who simply dislike them, or they may be ‘economically evicted’ due to arbitrary increases in their rent. Providing tenants with security of tenure (i.e. protection from involuntary or arbitrary eviction) requires that we not only ensure that housing units are well-maintained and safe for inhabitation, but that we also prevent landlords from unduly exercising their economic power over tenants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="365:1-365:272"&gt;Earlier, I examined the theoretical basis for a well-designed rent control, and concluded that it was an ineffective tool for ensuring affordability or preventing gentrification. However, rent regulations do seem to be effective at keeping current tenants in their homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="367:1-367:690"&gt;For example, consider the case of Massachusetts, which abolished its rent controls in 1994. Four years later, the &lt;em&gt;Economist&lt;/em&gt; reported that in Cambridge “nearly 40% of tenants in regulated flats moved out after rent control ended”, and that “decontrolled rents overall jumped by more than 50% between 1994 and 1997”.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-economist-1998" id="fnref-economist-1998" data-footnote-ref&gt;89&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;  David Sims, writing in 2007 about the same decontrol event, found that “decontrol is associated with a decrease of renter stays of 1.84 years”, which is rather “sizeable when compared to the mean renter stay of 6 years in the sample”.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-sims-2007" id="fnref-sims-2007-3" data-footnote-ref&gt;77&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This is framed as a loss of efficiency in terms of labour mobility, but I’m not sure it’s that cut and dry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="369:1-369:850"&gt;Most striking is the result from Rebecca Diamond et al’s research. They frame rent regulations as a kind of insurance against rent increases whose cost in practice is borne by all tenants, as the restriction in supply causes unregulated or vacant rents to rise more than they would have otherwise. They then found that tenants receiving rent control were up to 20% likelier to remain in their apartments and that “absent rent control essentially all of those incentivized to stay in their apartments would have otherwise moved out of San Francisco”. Diamond et al conclude that the gains in welfare those tenants experience narrowly outweigh the resulting deadweight loss incurred on others, but argue that providing this insurance function directly as a government subsidy or tax credit would be more efficient.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-practical-insurance" id="fnref-practical-insurance" data-footnote-ref&gt;90&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-diamond-2017" id="fnref-diamond-2017-2" data-footnote-ref&gt;78&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="373:1-373:504"&gt;Given that the welfare gains for San Francisco alone are measured in the billions of dollars, that could be a sizeable intervention. But why shouldn’t we intervene? After all, we substantially subsidize private ownership. Its relative attractiveness as an investment is the direct result of government policy. The relative scarcity of land via exclusionary zoning is a government policy. Financial liberalization and the coupling of capital markets to home financing was the result of government policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="375:1-375:350"&gt;Most suggestions for how to improve the affordability of rental buildings involve either direct subsidies or the reinstitution of tax shelters, and the extent to which they are built at all today in Canada would not happen without the direct intervention of a government agency, the CMHC. It’s not like our housing markets exist in a state of nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-sourcepos="377:1-377:40"&gt;
&lt;a id="a-brief-history-of-housing-in-canada" class="anchor" href="#a-brief-history-of-housing-in-canada" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;A brief history of housing in Canada&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="379:1-379:430"&gt;Property rights and the markets they enable exist to the extent they are enforced and protected by the state. When we establish and regulate rights, we typically seek to balance the interests and concerns of everyone involved, and revisit those tradeoffs as our values and goals shift over time. We think our food should be safe to eat, our doctors should be well trained, and that you shouldn’t dump waste anywhere you feel like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="381:1-381:362"&gt;In Canada, it would be difficult to identify a time when we had a completely laissez-faire housing market. Some of our earliest municipal by-laws regulated building standards. First, we sought to improve our health, safety, fire, and construction standards, and later we gradually began to add a host of land use and development regulations.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-hulchanski-laissez" id="fnref-hulchanski-laissez" data-footnote-ref&gt;91&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="383:1-383:494"&gt;These regulations led to the elimination of unhealthy, unsafe and poor quality housing in urban areas. If in 1951 almost one out of every ten houses lacked basic plumbing facilities, by 1982 that had dropped to 1.6%.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-brescia-2005-4" id="fnref-brescia-2005-4" data-footnote-ref&gt;92&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; However, our improved housing standards and growing restrictions on land use led to an increase in the cost of its manufacture. As early as 1914, it became apparent that the private market alone was not providing enough low income housing.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-hulchanski-laissez" id="fnref-hulchanski-laissez-2" data-footnote-ref&gt;91&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="385:1-385:532"&gt;One intervention begat another. Federal incentives were introduced in 1938 to stimulate the development of low income rental housing, and by 1949 the government began to invest directly in its production.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-hulchanski-laissez" id="fnref-hulchanski-laissez-3" data-footnote-ref&gt;91&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Buoyed by the post-war economic and population boom,  we began to seriously expand our welfare state and, concerned with ensuring “enough rental housing production to nourish the golden goose of urban growth”, from 1965 to 1995 up to 10% of all new housing was some mix of social housing.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-suttor-abridged" id="fnref-suttor-abridged" data-footnote-ref&gt;93&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="387:1-387:444"&gt;These interventions were not limited to the poor – quite the opposite. In 1946, the CMHC was established with the aim of increasing home ownership among the broad middle and lower-middle class. Focusing mainly on making amortized mortgages work for house buyers and private investors in rental housing, by the mid-1960s most households obtained at least part of their mortgage loan directly from the federal government.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-hulchanski-bulletin38" id="fnref-hulchanski-bulletin38" data-footnote-ref&gt;94&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="389:1-389:635"&gt;In fact, most of the history of the role of Canadian government housing policy is an effort to assist ownership. In 2005 alone, more individual homeowners were helped through mortgage insurance than the number of all social housing units funded since the 1970s. In addition to creating cheaper loans, the federal government also provides subsidies through a variety of tax credits, tax sheltered investment vehicles, and tax exemptions. When the federal government began taxing capital gains it exempted the sale of primary residences, which by 2008 was costing almost $6 billion a year in uncollected revenue.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-hulchanski-bulletin38" id="fnref-hulchanski-bulletin38-2" data-footnote-ref&gt;94&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="391:1-391:487"&gt;In so far that our housing policy has targeted the middle class’ standard of living, it has been rather successful. As an investment asset, home ownership confers unique benefits: it provides shelter as well as equity that can be withdrawn later in life. Canadians who pay off their mortgages spend on average only 11% of their income on housing and, by 1999, the average homeowner earned 208% more income, and owned 70 times more wealth, than the average tenant.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-hulchanski-bulletin38" id="fnref-hulchanski-bulletin38-3" data-footnote-ref&gt;94&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-sourcepos="393:1-393:27"&gt;
&lt;a id="tenants-have-rights-too" class="anchor" href="#tenants-have-rights-too" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Tenants have rights too&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="395:1-395:401"&gt;This is to say, “what kind of living conditions do we want people to enjoy?”, and consequently, “what, exactly, should be the goal of our housing system?” have been considered important questions for over a century. Our answers to these questions have shifted over time. We began by regulating the safety of our housing, and today we significantly subsidize its ownership for those who can afford it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="397:1-397:620"&gt;Similarly, our perception of the nature of the relationship between property owners and tenants has also shifted.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-yorke-2015-note" id="fnref-yorke-2015-note" data-footnote-ref&gt;95&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Under common law, which concerned itself with a leaseholder’s (agricultural) relationship to the land, a landlord was under no statutory requirement to maintain the premises or conduct any repairs. Nor were there any limits on their power to evict or even seize the property of tenants. A review of the applicable laws in 1968 found that landlords possessed such a disparity of bargaining power that tenants did not have a freedom of contract in any real sense.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-hulchanski-tenant-rights" id="fnref-hulchanski-tenant-rights" data-footnote-ref&gt;96&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="401:1-401:536"&gt;For a variety of ethical, legal and economic reasons, it became clear that tenants deserved protection, and that applying antiquated land law principles to the modern urban apartment was totally unsuitable. Gradually the law caught up: Ontario adopted its first residential protection laws in 1970, while the notion that tenants deserve security of tenure was added by 1975. Today, landlords are seen as responsible for providing safe and livable accommodations, and that tenants should be protected from arbitrary evictions.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-yee-1989" id="fnref-yee-1989-2" data-footnote-ref&gt;88&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="403:1-403:638"&gt;Often, this is framed as a conflict of self-interests between landlords and tenants, where tenants suffer disproportionate costs when forced to move, and benefit from stability. In a perfect market, the average tenant should be free from arbitrary increases or poorly maintained units due to the emancipating effect of competition. But in practice, that doesn’t seem to describe reality. Given the possibility of economic eviction, the regulation of security of tenure must be accompanied by the regulation of rent.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-hulchanski-1984" id="fnref-hulchanski-1984" data-footnote-ref&gt;98&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; David Hulchanski, writing over thirty years ago, compares rent regulations to consumer protection laws:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-sourcepos="405:1-405:254"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="405:3-405:254"&gt;Where the rental market cannot function normally, such as in meeting supply, or when moving costs limit the mobility of consumer rental services […] regulations protect consumers who find themselves in inferior bargaining positions.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-hulchanski-1984" id="fnref-hulchanski-1984-2" data-footnote-ref&gt;98&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="407:1-407:773"&gt;Every regulation imposes tradeoffs, and in that light we can compare the regulation of rent with the regulation of fire safety. Mandating that landlords’ properties satisfy certain minimum fire safety standards also raises costs and therefore diminishes the affordability of housing. Though some are happy to make that macabre argument,&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-mcardle-2017-note" id="fnref-mcardle-2017-note" data-footnote-ref&gt;99&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; by and large we’ve decided it’s a cost worth bearing: individual people are rarely in position to demand improved construction standards, and fires impose costs on everyone around it. At some point, we will always be dealing with thresholds and equilibriums, and it is up to society to decide what is or isn’t acceptable: in Ontario, only about 7 people per million die every year in residential fires.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-fire-deaths" id="fnref-fire-deaths" data-footnote-ref&gt;100&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="411:1-411:198"&gt;And, much like fire safety, security of tenure doesn’t just benefit individual tenants. The stability provided by security of tenure is the stuff from which well functioning communities are made of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-sourcepos="413:1-413:39"&gt;
&lt;a id="security-of-tenure-is-a-public-good" class="anchor" href="#security-of-tenure-is-a-public-good" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Security of tenure is a public good&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="415:1-415:368"&gt;In economics there exists a concept of a “public good”, which broadly applies to any “service” or “thing that people derive benefit from” that is both non-excludable and non-rivalrous. Non-excludable means that you can’t prevent people from enjoying it; non-rivalrous means that by enjoying the good you are not depriving other people from doing the same.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-cowen-2007" id="fnref-cowen-2007" data-footnote-ref&gt;102&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="417:1-417:658"&gt;The classical examples include clean air, national security, knowledge, and so on. I can’t prevent you from breathing in the same fresh air that I’m enjoying, and when you consume official government statistics you are not depriving me of the same benefit. Public goods aren’t necessarily provided by the state, much the same way that the state provides access to some private goods. The distinction is relevant because the nature of public goods incentivizes people to be jerks and therefore public goods “must be provided for everyone if they are to be provided for anyone, and they must be paid for collectively or they cannot be had at all”.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-galea-2016" id="fnref-galea-2016" data-footnote-ref&gt;103&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="419:1-419:462"&gt;Though housing itself is a private good, one’s enjoyment of security does not impinge on the security of others. As we’ve seen, security of tenure cannot be provided without a collective investment of some sort since individual tenants rarely possess the bargaining power to afford it themselves. But more importantly, security of tenure provides benefits to the community at large – and also suffers from the free-rider problem that plagues other public goods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-sourcepos="421:1-421:45"&gt;
&lt;a id="security-of-tenure-is-good-for-the-public" class="anchor" href="#security-of-tenure-is-good-for-the-public" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Security of tenure is good for the public&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="423:1-423:442"&gt;Our communities consist of both physical infrastructure, like roads and public transit, as well as “human” infrastructure, like community organizations and loose neighbourhood ties. A neighbourhood may be desirable for its proximity to a grocery store – but also for the quality of its schools, the absence of crime and the vitality of its community events. A healthy neighbourhood is one where its residents are looking out for one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="425:1-425:389"&gt;When landlords raise rents above costs, they are in effect cashing in on new or improved local amenities provided either by the state or the local community itself. The reduction of crime, or the expansion of public transit, readily provide rationales for increasing rents. Creating conditions where tenants may reasonably fear investment in their communities is a rather perverse outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="427:1-427:229"&gt;Tenants face substantial hurdles. I recently read Matthew Desmond’s incredible and harrowing book &lt;em&gt;Evicted&lt;/em&gt;, in which he followed several low-income renters in the city of Milwaukee over the course of a year. Early on, he writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-sourcepos="429:1-429:785"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="429:3-429:785"&gt;“The public peace–the sidewalk and street peace–of cities is not kept primarily by the police, necessary as police are. It is kept primarily by an intricate, almost unconscious, network of voluntary controls and standards among the people themselves, and enforced by the people themselves.” So wrote Jane Jacobs in &lt;em&gt;The Death and Life of Great American Cities&lt;/em&gt;. Jacobs believed that a prerequisite for this type of healthy and engaged community was the presence of people who were simply present, who looked after the neighborhood.  She has been proved right: disadvantaged neighborhoods with higher levels of “collective efficacy”–the stuff of loosely linked neighbors who trust one another and share expectations about how to make their community better–have lower crime rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="431:1-431:37"&gt;Towards the end of the book, he adds:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-sourcepos="434:1-434:429"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="434:3-434:429"&gt;Residential stability begets a kind of psychological stability, which allows people to invest in their home and social relationships. It begets school stability, which increases the chances that children will excel and graduate. And it begets community stability, which encourages neighbours to form strong bonds and take care of their block. But poor families enjoy little of that because they are evicted at such high rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-sourcepos="436:1-436:5"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="436:3-436:5"&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-sourcepos="438:1-438:535"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="438:3-438:535"&gt;Eviction even affects the communities that displaced families leave behind. Neighbors who cooperate with and trust one another can make their streets safer and more prosperous. But that takes time. Efforts to establish local cohesion and community investment are thwarted in neighborhoods with high turnover rates. In this way, eviction can unravel the fabric of a community, helping to ensure that neighbors remain strangers and that their collective capacity to combat crime and promote civic engagement remains untapped.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-desmond" id="fnref-desmond" data-footnote-ref&gt;104&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="440:1-440:325"&gt;Faced with the unpredictable but certain need to move in the near future, it’s harder to establish deep ties to a neighbourhood. As a result, tenants are routinely discounted or ignored by our political structures,&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-mcgrath-2017-note" id="fnref-mcgrath-2017-note" data-footnote-ref&gt;105&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and face greater hardships accessing necessary social services and economic opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="444:1-444:622"&gt;In 2016, the New Zealand Housing Foundation commissioned Charles Waldegrave et al to undergo a literature review of the “Social and Economic Impacts of Housing Tenure” and the results are rather bleak. Being a homeowner, as opposed to a tenant, means you live longer and are both physically and psychologically healthier. It makes you less likely to retire early due to health reasons and homeowners on average spend less time unemployed. Owners live in neighbourhoods with lower crime rates, and their children are less likely to suffer from depression, and are more likely to graduate from high school.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-waldegrave-2016" id="fnref-waldegrave-2016" data-footnote-ref&gt;107&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="446:1-446:807"&gt;Some of these effects are undoubtedly due to homeowners’ higher levels of income and wealth. Life is much less stressful if you have the financial cushion to weather various misfortunes. However, these effects mostly persist even after controlling for socio-economic status and/or income. Waldegrave et al note that their study is limited, and did not include studies that focused on mortgage and rent stress though “it is acknowledged that unaffordable housing of whatever tenure type will almost certainly lead to negative health and social outcomes”.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-waldegrave-2016" id="fnref-waldegrave-2016-2" data-footnote-ref&gt;107&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; A few of the studies they encountered did not find meaningful differences once they accounted for &lt;em&gt;residential stability&lt;/em&gt; – and, after income, that instability is arguably the main source of stress differentiating owners from tenants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="448:1-448:181"&gt;In practical terms, it’s hard to avoid the inference that being a tenant is a rather harsh externality that our housing policies impose largely on the poor and the recent immigrant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a id="conclusions" class="anchor" href="#conclusions" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="452:1-452:489"&gt;A popular urbanist school of thought posits that our cities are the economic engines of the future. Globalization diminished the importance of physical distance in the manufacturing economy, but the resulting shift to the service economy has magnified the importance of clustering effects and economies of scale provided by greater densities of goods and people – to say nothing about the looming threat of climate change and the environmental unsustainability of our low density suburbs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="454:1-454:774"&gt;In this view, it’s not hard to imagine a near future where the equity requirements of residential ownership (let alone freehold structures) has priced out most people. Back in March 2017, CIBC’s Benjamin Tal wrote that “the GTA market is fast approaching a full-blown affordability crisis” as a surge in demand due to “a notable increase in speculative and flipping activity” is pricing out most people from ownership markets. He argues that therefore municipalities must “rethink the role of rental activity in the region’s housing mix”.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-tal-rent-2017" id="fnref-tal-rent-2017" data-footnote-ref&gt;108&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Though I am prone to quibble with some of his preferred solutions,&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-greenbelt-note" id="fnref-greenbelt-note" data-footnote-ref&gt;109&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; it seems correct to observe that current macro economic conditions are rushing us towards a new era of unobtainable ownership prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="458:1-458:619"&gt;In 2011, a little under half of the population of the city of Toronto rented their housing,&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-census-2011" id="fnref-census-2011" data-footnote-ref&gt;110&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and the preliminary results from the 2016 census suggest renting is poised for a comeback. Rental housing dominates recent growth and change, and home-ownership is now out of reach for the young and the middle- and low-income.&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-suttor-2017" id="fnref-suttor-2017" data-footnote-ref&gt;111&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It’s become fun for real estate commentators to shrug and joke about life being unfair,&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-carrick-note" id="fnref-carrick-note" data-footnote-ref&gt;112&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but our housing universe and its financing mechanisms aren’t just some random happenstance – they’re the result of decisions and policies we have made over the decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="462:1-462:660"&gt;Critics do us a disservice by pretending rent controls are about affordability or supply. The best rationale for instituting rent controls is that of ensuring security of tenure, and in an environment where rents are rapidly increasing it becomes necessary to regulate rent. Not only do tenants deserve security of tenure, but they lead healthier, more productive lives in safer, more pleasant communities when residential stability can be taken for granted. Early rent controls were poorly designed; but a regulation that controls the rate of price inflation, while allowing for legitimate cost increases to be recouped, can be both sustainable and equitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="464:1-464:530"&gt;A close examination of recent construction starts, and policy changes affecting the economics of purpose built rental buildings, reveals that Ontario’s rent regulations are likely not the main disincentive removing supply from our housing markets. The legalization of condominiums in 1967 and the federal government’s overhaul of the Income Tax Act in 1972 (amongst other tax changes) had a big impact on the relative profitability of rental buildings, and are likely the cause of their decline relative to other kinds of housing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="466:1-466:473"&gt;Almost no two rent controls are the same, and one has to be very careful when comparing different cities or regions. There is evidence from other jurisdictions with similar kinds of rent controls to that of Ontario’s current regime that shows a lack of effect on the supply of new housing. Anyone who, when discussing rent controls, does not bring up the problem of security of tenure, or blithely compares regulations from different jurisdictions, may be pulling your leg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="468:1-468:249"&gt;Finally, housing is complicated and our governments routinely intervene and shape its outcomes. They did a great job creating and subsidizing suburbs and middle class ownership, but they are currently failing the poor and people who live in cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="470:1-470:409"&gt;For better or for worse, renting is the future. Long-term tenants have a legitimate interest in staying in the communities they have made successful – and it’s in society’s interest that they lead stable, successful lives. Tenants do not deserve to be subjected to a tenure regime that significantly disadvantages them socially, economically, and politically compared to the subsidized homeowning population.&lt;/p&gt;

For information prior to then, I had to look it up in individual yearly housing statistics publications. However, the yearly publications only began to distinguish starts or completions by intended market starting in 1985 (presumably this data was collected prior to then, but simply not aggregated and published). In order to make the time frame being compared as similar as possible, I relied on a City of Toronto report. &lt;a href="#fnref-note-digging" class="footnote-backref" data-footnote-backref aria-label="Back to content"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-sourcepos="256:21-256:460"&gt;Arnott makes the case that housing markets are actually monopolistically competitive since housing structures and preferences are not homogenous, there are substantial asymmetries in information, and transactions costs are non-trivial. Consequently, rents are set higher than their efficient level and the corresponding deadweight loss can be mitigated (Arnott 2003, p. 106). But for our purposes we don’t need to engage with this argument. &lt;a href="#fnref-arnott-monopoly" class="footnote-backref" data-footnote-backref aria-label="Back to content"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id="fn-august-note"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="325:18-325:1121"&gt;August goes a step further and documents how vacancy decontrol in Ontario was likely designed as a predatory move: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“In 1998, Residential Equities REIT (ResREIT) was launched, with plans to acquire 27 Ontario properties “to more fully benefit from the anticipated relaxation of rent controls in Ontario, with legislation expected to be proclaimed in force in April 1998”. Quite notably, ResREIT was launched by Dino Chiesa, Assistant Deputy Minister in the Housing Ministry during the time the 1997 Tenant Protection Act (TPA) was conceived. Immediately after, he left public office and started ResREIT to directly profit from new opportunities for rental increases in legislation he helped to craft”&lt;sup class="footnote-ref"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn-august-2017" id="fnref-august-2017-2" data-footnote-ref&gt;75&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; August’s paper makes a compelling argument for the role of (vacancy controlling) rent controls, paired with condominium conversion restrictions, in acting as a kind of stabilizer that disincentivizes predatory gentrification and preserves existing affordable units. I came across it only after I’d written this paper, hence this footnote and quick mention above. &lt;a href="#fnref-august-note" class="footnote-backref" data-footnote-backref aria-label="Back to content"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id="fn-practical-insurance"&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="371:25-371:721"&gt;I’m not sure that insurance is practical. Insurance can either be privately mandated or publically provided. A private mandate is a non-starter; a control at least saves us from the cost of an administrative apparatus. A public provision is more appealing. On the one hand, funding it from the population at large would be more progressive than just across tenants. On the other hand  every insurance function I’m aware of eventually acts to cap costs and so it’s not clear to me landlords would end up in a significantly different position. That said, a public rent insurance program could be very politically useful: it would re-normalize the routine direct public provision of housing services. &lt;a href="#fnref-practical-insurance" class="footnote-backref" data-footnote-backref aria-label="Back to content"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-sourcepos="456:21-456:603"&gt;Relaxing intensification targets and eating away at the Greenbelt seems short sighted. It says a lot that in terms of our political economy giving up those goals is easier than rezoning our land and increasing density. However, it will harm us in the long run as we miss out on economic clustering effects and continue to waste good money on unsustainable low density development. While I’m at it, the implicit assumption that the present equilibrium, where land prices are allowed to inflate at arbitrary values, is value neutral or not worth direct policy action is rather suspect. &lt;a href="#fnref-greenbelt-note" class="footnote-backref" data-footnote-backref aria-label="Back to content"&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Actually, Rent Control Is Great</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p data-sourcepos="1:1-1:288"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A version of this article was published in the &lt;a href="https://www.thestar.com/opinion/contributors/2017/11/18/rent-controls-promote-stability-mendona-vieira.html"&gt;Toronto Star&lt;/a&gt;. Interested in learning more? You can &lt;a href="/2018/rent-control-great-security-of-tenure.html"&gt;read the full paper here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="3:1-3:502"&gt;I’ve been renting in Toronto for almost a decade now, and I’ve watched rents in my neighbourhood(s) climb substantially. In that period I have moved eight times, and whenever I have looked for housing the uncertainty of living in an uncontrolled apartment weighed heavily on my mind. That’s why I got excited when, back in April of this year, the government of Ontario announced that it was extending rent control to every dwelling in the province, as opposed to just buildings constructed before 1991.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="5:1-5:384"&gt;However, this move prompted a lot of commentary, and the chorus was overwhelmingly negative. Critics argued that, under rent control, the quantity and quality of available rental units will fall as developers are less incentivized to build rental properties, and that the province should instead tackle the root of the problem: the supply of new housing is not keeping up with demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="7:1-7:271"&gt;To me this was strange, since removing the exemption seemed like such a no-brainer. And, much to my disappointment, few if any critics actually addressed what I felt was the real problem at hand: the lack of security of tenure. This prompted me to look into the research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="9:1-9:648"&gt;Housing insecurity means you have to move all the time, which is expensive, but the real cost is in the instability it inflicts. The constant possibility of eviction, two months’ notice, changes your relationship with the community around you. If your stay is likely to be short, then volunteering at your local school or investing in strong local ties doesn’t make a lot of sense. Quite the opposite: it may well be in your interest that your community not improve or appreciate &lt;em&gt;too much&lt;/em&gt;. A brand new transit line or community centre that causes the cost of your home to exceed your resources and forces you to move is no cause for celebration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="11:1-11:744"&gt;Studies have found that being a homeowner, as opposed to a tenant, means you live longer and are both physically and psychologically healthier. It makes you less likely to retire early due to health reasons and homeowners on average spend less time unemployed. Owners live in neighbourhoods with lower crime rates, and their children are less likely to suffer from depression, and are more likely to graduate from high school. These effects persist even after controlling for wealth and income, but tend to go away when we control for residential stability. Since we spend many times more money subsidizing homeownership than we do helping tenants, it’s hard to avoid the conclusion that we deliberately impose these externalities on renters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="13:1-13:791"&gt;Meanwhile, data shows that Ontario’s rent controls do not actually have the pernicious effect on the supply of new rental housing that is attributed to them. Consider that rent control in new buildings was permanently exempted back in 1998 — yet rental housing starts have failed to recover, and today we build far less rental housing than we did in the 1970s and 1980s. While a strict price control that causes real costs to rise above real incomes is indeed harmful, that does not accurately describe the kind of rent control we have in Ontario. A well designed control, one that allows rents to rise with costs and inflation, does not actually harm new supply, and this is corroborated by researchers that examined controls similar to ours in Manitoba, New Jersey and Massachusetts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="fref:fig1"&gt;
&lt;a href="/img/Ontario%20Housing%20Starts%201969-2016%20With%20Condos.png"&gt;&lt;img src="/img/Ontario%20Housing%20Starts%201969-2016%20With%20Condos.png" style="max-width:100%;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Figure 1.&lt;/b&gt; Ontario housing starts by intended market 1969-2016. Data from 1987 onwards is restricted to areas with over 10,000 people, and therefore undercounts total starts.
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="23:1-23:772"&gt;A more likely explanation for the squeezing of our primary rental housing supply in recent decades can be found in the legalization of condos, in 1967, and the federal government’s overhaul of our tax system in 1972 and other changes in subsequent years. Prior to the &lt;em&gt;Condominium Act&lt;/em&gt; all apartment buildings were rentals, since title could not be sold for individual units. And prior to the revisions of the &lt;em&gt;Income Tax Act&lt;/em&gt; rental buildings were attractive tax shelters for high income individuals looking for stable returns on their investment. Since today building to own is less risky and more profitable than building to rent, in practice condominiums have crowded out investment in rental buildings. Their impact is easy to see in Toronto’s housing statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="fref:fig2"&gt;
&lt;a href="/img/Toronto%20Housing%20Completions%201981-2016.png"&gt;&lt;img src="/img/Toronto%20Housing%20Completions%201981-2016.png" style="max-width:100%;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Figure 2.&lt;/b&gt; City of Toronto housing completions by intended market 1981-2016.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p data-sourcepos="31:1-31:473"&gt;Commentators do us a disservice when they pretend rent controls are about affordability or redistribution and ignore tenant concerns over security of tenure. From what I’ve learned it’s way more complicated than that. Today, low- and middle-income people have been priced out of ownership in our city. Why should we be subjected to a tenancy regime that significantly disadvantages us socially, economically and politically compared to the subsidized homeowning population?&lt;/p&gt;</content>
