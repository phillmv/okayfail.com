The best way to destroy a city, short of bombing, to let a real estate bubble eat through everything that makes it vibrant and unique. When land prices and rents rise much faster than incomes, the outcome is rather sad to observe: the city is quickly hollowed out. First its people leave and soon after so does its culture. We are now seeing this in Toronto.

Our city is being homogenized, rendered bland not just in its geographic sorting of people by ethnicity and social class but also in its elimination of opportunity and innovation.[^tale-two-cities] We pride ourselves for our diversity but our city has become cruel and inhospitable to the indigent, the young, the newcomer. New ideas need old buildings, said Jane Jacobs, but what she meant specifically is that new ideas need _cheap rent_.[^jacobs]


It is fair and correct to observe that when demand is high and supply is low, prices will soon increase. It does not take much effort to see the inadequacy of our housing stock; our rental buildings are crumbling,[^highrise-hell] our condos are poorly laid out,[^poorly-laid-out] our social housing is a disgrace[^crumbling-social-housing] and yet many a private, freehold homeowner is a short distance from high quality jobs, transit, schools and other amenities. As I walk through our streets I yearn to tear every single family home down brick by brick and replace it with a three storey walkup &mdash; six apartments of five and a half rooms plus a balcony laid out in its stead.[^confession]

Yet it is also fair to wonder about all this insatiable demand.

Where does it come from? A new, sizable generation is coming of age and after all most of the city was not born here. Sure. But our supply is not that inadequate.[^market-urbanism] Who are these people waging bidding wars, and who armed them with such terrible wealth?

It has become impossible to ignore the flood of capital that is washing around us. A little under half of Toronto condo investors last year are renting their units for less than it costs to carry the investment.[^urbanation-cibc] In 2016 and 2017, speculators made up _all of the growth_ in the sales volume of low-rise houses.[^pasalis] Residential buildings have been turned into ghost hotels, their long term tenants turfed for tourists on Airbnb.[^ghost-hotel] Large REITs are buying up affordably priced rental buildings in order to accelerate their gentrification.[^august-2017] Immense volumes of global wealth are pouring into our cities;[^global-wealth] the price of high-end detached houses in Vancouver now track capital outflows from China.[^vancouver-china] 

It is clear that our housing has become financialized. Financialization is when a service or commodity is turned into a tradable asset that then becomes desirable primarily for its ability to store and exchange value. When something becomes financialized, its production and commerce becomes dominated by its interaction with financial markets. Its original utility becomes secondary to its use as a flywheel for money.

Bombs attack buildings, but financialization attacks people. Homes were meant to provide shelter, but now they're something else.  

Rampant housing inflation seeps through the economy. It becomes a tax capital charges labour, as high rents eat away at every productive activity a city engages in. First, the poor are evicted, then the artists and the working class. Eventually, the petit bourgeois whose services defined the contours of the neighbourhood undergo a kind of deluxification. The local grocer blossoms into a hip restaurant. The butcher is replaced by another butcher, but one that deals exclusively in fair trade organic. Heaven help you find a daycare.

Our markets are failing us. Uncontrolled land speculation doesn't just harm the marginalized. It poisons the economy. Money follows the path of least resistence. Every week now we hear a new alarm being sounded over our looming debt crisis.[^wsj] We could have used this wave of cheap capital to fund productive investments, but instead we plowed it into renovations and McMansions. In order for our housing markets to function, our pricing mechanism must reflect the actual local demand for physical shelter and not the aggregate global demand for safe financial assets.

It's worth asking why. Why allow this to continue? The fiscal demand for housing may well always outstrip our ability to dig holes in the ground.[^speculation] What purpose does it serve to allow the cost of housing services to inflate beyong people's ability to pay for it? Land is completely unlike any other commodity. There has never been a free market in land and there likely will never be one. When our market fail us, it is up to us to reshape them and make them useful again.

Why does most of the benefit from upzoning accrue to land owners? Why shouldn't we discourage the practice of land banking? Why shouldn't we disincentivize fallow housing? Why do we allow wantom speculation models to destroy affordable housing?

We can do lots of things. We can tax certain kinds of unproductive activity. We can keep better track of sales and financing information. We can prevent extractive business models via the judicious use of rent controls. We can tax wealth. We can legalize better kinds of density. Most importantly, we can build public housing that can sit outside of whims of the markets.

We have lots of tools at our disposal. It's time we used them.

[^tale-two-cities]: "Toronto’s levels of income inequality and neighbourhood income polarization are proof of a broken opportunity equation. Access to opportunity plus hard work no longer equals success. In a region marked by islands of wealth and poverty, where you live increasingly determines your access to opportunity—and a better life." https://imagineacity.ca/2017/11/01/a-tale-of-two-torontos/

[^jacobs]: I for one have not read _The Death and Life of Great American Cities_, but certain quotes become received wisdom. To wit, "If a city area has only new buildings, the enterprises that can exist there are automatically limited to those that can support the high costs of new construction."

[^poorly-laid-out]: "But between the high monthly carrying costs with these units and, in many cases, their poor layouts and tight quarters, three-bedroom condominiums are often winding up in the hands of property investors who have turned them into student rooming houses in the sky." https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/condos-for-families-without-the-space/article22602785/

[^confession]: Almost as much as I yearn to own such a home myself. I am not immune to luxury.

[^market-urbanism]: I'm fond of quoting American housing wonk Steven Smith, [who helpfully](https://twitter.com/MarketUrbanism/status/954402978454278144) [keeps pointing out](https://twitter.com/MarketUrbanism/status/954403144846446593) how well Toronto performs by American coastal city standards.<br/><br>"I guess I would also recommend that they make rentals easier to build (exempt them from rent control, deal with the differential taxation issues). However, [Toronto's] new condo supply is absolutely enormous and it’s almost all going to be rented out in the coming years so I’m not sure that supply is really the issue at this point (Toronto’s housing stock growth rate is on par with Houston and Dallas’s!!). Seems more like animal spirits at this point in the cycle"<br/><br/>Tho we tend to [lack self-confidence](https://twitter.com/MarketUrbanism/status/967446607078875136).

[^urbanation-cibc]: "No less than 44 per cent of investors who took possession of new units in 2017 were in negative cash flow — that is their rental income fell short of the amount needed to cover their mortgage payments and condominium fees" https://www.urbanation.ca/news/217-condo-owners-make-big-gains-nearly-half-arent-making-enough-rent-cover-costs

[^pasalis]: "Looking at the total increase in low-rise house sales from 2015 to 2016, we found that investors accounted for 43% of this increase.<br/><br/>Looking at the increase in the number of low-rise sales between Q1 2017 and Q1 2016, we found that investors accounted for 171% of this increase – without this, overall sales would have fallen during the first quarter of 2017. It appears that towards the end of the bubble, regular buyers started to pull out of the market while investors were still rushing in." https://www.movesmartly.com/lessons-learned-from-toronto-2017-real-estate-bubble

[^global-wealth]: "Indeed, Laurence D. Fink, the chairman and chief executive officer of the asset-management firm BlackRock, recently announced that "apartments in Manhattan, apartments in Vancouver [and] in London," along with fine art, have now replaced gold as the primary store of wealth." https://www.citylab.com/equity/2015/06/the-big-money-behind-tall-buildings/395690/

[^vancouver-china]: "Indeed, this year’s move by China’s authoritarian leaders to severely restrict how much money they will allow to leave their populous country appears to be a key reason prices on high-end detached houses in Metro have this fall been dropping by 15 to 20 per cent, even if most of the public hasn’t noticed." http://vancouversun.com/opinion/columnists/douglas-todd-vancouvers-housing-crisis-revealed-by-looking-to-china-australia-new-zealand

[^wsj]: “Ian Harnett, chief investment strategist at Absolute Strategy Research in London, adds Norway and New Zealand to [Canada, Australia and Sweden]. Helped by a mix of commodities and exports to China they avoided the worst of the credit crunch in 2008-09, but still benefited from the low global rates that followed. ‘The result was they got the wrong price of capital,’ he says. [...]<br/><br/>Look at house price to income ratios. In 2007 the housing bubbles of Ireland and Spain led the world on this measure, according to OECD data. Now Canada, Australia and Sweden, along with New Zealand and Norway, are well ahead of other developed countries—and close to the Irish and Spanish 2007 levels.[...]<br/><br/> Sweden, Australia and Canada have a multiplying factor if trouble hits: Banks are financing themselves abroad, often on a fairly short-term basis. This exposes them to any tightening of global funding conditions; both after Lehman and in the 2011-12 eurozone panic troubles were exacerbated by a shortage of dollars outside the U.S." https://www.wsj.com/articles/to-spot-the-next-financial-crisis-look-who-was-spared-by-the-last-one-1524753989

[^speculation]: If speculation is a bet on future scarcity, then why would speculative interests allow us to escape a condition of scarcity? Preventing future scarcity liekly requires us to regulate those who benefit from it.
