I'm adding a [garden section](/garden.html) to this website,[^garden] in the hope that I am able to make something interesting bloom.

I've been enjoying Lu's [wikiblogarden](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/), and been feeling inspired by the idea of [keeping a slippy mindset](https://www.tadiweb.com/).

For a long time I have been consumed with _hot takes_ and ideas that are too long to fit in a social media post, but not fleshed out enough to be a Full Thought Bearing The Full Weight of my Endorsement. That might sound like a weirdly high bar for my own rinky dink little personal website – but once I started publishing [semi-novel housing research](/2021/british-columbia-more-yimby-california.html), and [exhaustively footnoted treatises on rent control](/2018/rent-control-great-security-of-tenure.html), it felt awkward to put out half-baked ideas in the same "area".

And so those ideas languished, with nowhere to put them.

A separate section is an attempt to break that feeling of awkwardness. I'd like to experiment with writing _more_ silly and semi-serious ideas, in the hopes that those ideas either grow or, together, form an interesting corpus.
