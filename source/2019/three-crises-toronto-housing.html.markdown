subject: The Three Crises in Toronto Housing
---

In 2019, Toronto is in the midst of a housing crisis. Knowing this is easy, because the crisis is palpable: we have skyrocketing ownership and rent prices and an escalating emergency in our homeless shelter system.

Talking about housing is hard, though, because it's such a complex topic. When we talk about housing, we try to discuss how we want to live.

Start talking about how the price of rent is too damn high and before long you'll find yourself with opinions about local land use policy, and urban planning but also price controls, the residential construction industry, financial markets, interest rates, mortgage insurance, tax credits and fiscal policy, the natural rights of tenants and freeholders and so on.

Talking about housing is confusing, but it doesn't have to be. I spend a lot of time talking, reading and thinking about housing, and I've come to believe that when we talk about the housing crisis in Toronto in 2019 we are actually talking about three related, but distinct, problems or crises.

### The three specific problems we face in Toronto housing:

1. There is an insufficient supply of housing for low-income households.
2. A growing share of the population suffers from rampant housing insecurity.
3. The built environment that our housing system favours and produces is ecologically unsustainable and harmful to our health and quality of life.

I will go as far as to say that _every_ housing discussion, especially on twitter, can be reduced to one of these three questions. Let's quickly explore these.

### 1. The insufficient supply of housing for low-income households

Simply put, if you don't have money you can't pay for rent. Likewise, no market is going to build housing for people who cannot pay for the marginal cost of its production.

Low-income people thus live in constant threat of homelessness because they lack income: should they lose their current housing arrangement, they are unlikely to find another accomodation that is as affordable.

Since shelter is essential for people to live, we therefore must subsidize low-income households much the same way we provide education and healthcare for everyone.

We could cut people cheques, but it's more efficient in the long run for the government to own the land and operate the buildings, so we might as well do that. This roughly describes the bottom 30% of the population by income distribution.

### 2. Rampant housing insecurity

financialization of housing and discrimination against tenants

### 3. Inadequate built environment

zoning laws.
