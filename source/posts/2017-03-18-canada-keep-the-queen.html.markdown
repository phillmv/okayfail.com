Let's talk about the Queen. I have dire news: at the time of writing she is ninety years old, and she's not getting any younger.

After sixty five years on the job, it's difficult to imagine anyone else inhabiting the role. Popes come and go; POTUS' and prime-ministers rotate on the regular, but the Queen kept on keeping on throughout the twentieth century and well into this one.

A recent article in the *Guardian* explained [what'll happen when the Queen kicks it](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/mar/16/what-happens-when-queen-elizabeth-dies-london-bridge). There is a vast machinery in place for the English, proud, vain and fond of their symbols and rituals, to exercise their mass grief. Every news channel will pause and emit the same message, the streets will be clogged with mourners and into the ground she will go, wrapped in a lead coffin[^coffin].

What comes next will be even sadder, and more terrible.

It is at this point that Charles will receive the Mandate of Heaven and ascend to the throne. He will become King and assume her responsibilities as sovereign of the various Commonwealth countries. 

It's not his fault he will be disappointing. He's just... unexceptional.

<h3>It's time for Canada to Brexit</h3>

I don’t have to tell you it’s insulting that a country as vibrant, diverse and democratic as ours is represented by some old white guy who inherited the job. That it’s time for us to move beyond our shameful colonial past and present into our [confident, multicultural future](http://www.vox.com/2016/6/8/11879482/ramadan-justin-trudeau-canada). I’ve come to believe that it is the duty of all loyal and patriotic Canadians everywhere to prevent this event from ever coming to pass.

We are overdue for reconsidering our relationship with the United Kingdom. Our Crown should Brexit, and be done with it. But what of the legal and political implications of such a break? The very idea of [revisiting our constitutional agreements](https://thewalrus.ca/what-constitutes-our-constitution/) is enough to bore most people to tears. Surely, this will provoke years of pointless debates and fights between the provinces.

To you I say, fear not.

I have devised the ultimate, _most Canadian_ solution to our conundrum. When the time comes, we should simply **do nothing**.

That’s right. When our beloved Queen passes away, we should simply _preserve the status quo_. Keep her as the queen in perpetuity. Canada will keep on being a constitutional monarchy, we’ll keep on playing games in the Commonwealth or whatever, and the Queen of Canada will soldier on as a literal symbolic figurehead that has no actual bearing on the functioning of our country.

We keep Charles off our money, we avoid any stupid fights with either Québec or Alberta, and we get to keep referring to the Crown using female pronouns, which I’ve always found to be quaint and pleasant.

<h3>A Queen for everyone</h3>

Better yet, once we grow comfortable with a purely symbolic Queen, she can become representative of us all. We can hold contests so that any female-identifying person in Canada may embody the Queen, for a day. We can appropriate the symbols of the Crown to fashion a self image that doesn't rely on Anglo colonial settlers and their multicoloured wool blankets.

I ask you and all of you to stand strong with me and #KeepTheQueen, and make Canada great again.
