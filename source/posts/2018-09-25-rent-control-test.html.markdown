### Abstract

Rent controls are criticized for acting as a severe disincentive to new and existing rental construction. From 1992 to 2017, the province of Ontario exempted all new buildings from its rent control regime. What was the effect on rental construction in Ontario during that time period? Finding that rental construction continues to be depressed, this paper documents contemporary Canadian housing policy initiatives and investigates the theoretical and empirical record of rent controls in other jurisdictions. This paper then argues that rent controls' most important aspect is their regulation of the provision of security of tenure -- which should be seen as a right of tenants as well as homeowners.

*Keywords:* rent control, security of tenure, housing, Ontario, Canada
