title: Financialization Is A Fire That Burns Cities
draft: true

The best way to destroy a city, short of bombing, to let a real estate bubble eat through everything that makes it vibrant and unique. We see this in Toronto,  which in recent years has experienced a rapid and uncontrolled inflation in its land prices. The outcome is rather sad to observe. The city is being hollowed out. 


Our city is being homogenized, rendered bland not just in its geographic sorting of people by ethnicity and social class but also in its elimination of opportunity and innovation.[^tale-two-cities] We pride ourselves for our diversity but our city has become cruel and inhospitable to the indigent, the young, the newcomer. New ideas need old buildings, said Jane Jacobs, but what she meant specifically is that new ideas need _cheap rent_.

It is fair and correct to observe that when demand is high and supply is low, prices are soon to increase. It does not take much effort to see the inadequacy of our housing stock; our rental buildings are crumbling,[^highrise-hell] our condos are poorly laid out,[^poorly-laid-out] our social housing is a disgrace[^crumbling-social-housing] and yet many a private, freehold homeowner is a short distance from high quality jobs, transit, schools and other amenities. As I walk through our streets I yearn to tear every single family home down brick by brick and replace it with a three or four storey walkup &mdash; six or eight apartments of five and a half rooms plus a balcony laid out in its stead.[^confession]

Yet it is also fair to wonder about all this insatiable demand. 

Where does it come from? A new, sizable generation is coming of age and after all most of the city was not born here. Sure. But who are these people waging bidding wars, and who armed them with such terrible wealth?

It has become impossible to ignore the flood of capital that is washing around us. A little under half of Toronto condo investors last year are renting their units for less than it costs to carry the investment.[^urbanation-cibc] In 2016 and 2017, speculators made up _all of the growth_ in the sales volume of low-rise houses.[^pasalis] Residential buildings have been turned into ghost hotels, their long term tenants turfed for tourists on Airbnb.[^ghost-hotel] Large real estate investment trusts are buying affordably priced rental buildings in order to accelerate their gentrification.[^august-2017] Immense volumes of global wealth are pouring into our cities;[^global-wealth] the price of high-end detached houses in Vancouver now track capital outflows from China.[^vancouver-china]


Housing has become financialized. Financialization describes the process through which a service or commodity is turned into tradable assets that then becomes desirable primarily for its ability to store and exchange value. When something becomes financialized, its production and commerce becomes dominated by its interaction with financial markets. The original utility of the financialized object becomes secondary to its use as a flywheel for money.


Bombs attack buildings, but financialization attacks people. 

Homes were meant to provide shelter, but now they're something else. The uncontrolled inflation of land prices is a fire that burns through every productive activity a city engages in, raising rents and the cost of living in completely arbitrary ways. Neighbourhoods that welcomed generations of families are now theme parks for the wealthy. Housing inflation is a tax Capital charges Labour.

Our markets are failing us; we are grossly misallocating resources away from productive investments and into useless speculative gambles. Cash that could have provided the fuel for entrepreneurial sparks is now buried in renovations and McMansions. In order for our housing markets to function, our pricing mechanism must reflect the actual local demand for physical shelter and not the aggregate global demand for safe financial assets.

It's worth asking why. Why allow this to continue? What purpose does it serve to allow the cost of housing services to inflate wildly beyond people's ability to pay? Without curtailing the financialization of housing, we'll never be able to build enough. The fiscal demand for housing will always outstrip our ability to dig holes in the ground.

The term financialization describes the process through which a service or commodity is turned into tradable assets that then become desirable primarily for their ability to store and exchange value.

This is cute and amusing when applied to tulips, miniature plush toys or cryptographic tokens, but when it targets things people actually _need_ the impact quickly becomes tragic. So it is with our cities. Housing markets in places like Toronto and Vancouver have been experiencing rapid and uncontrolled inflation, and with it comes a rapid diminishment of our -->

Access to opportunity plus hard work no longer equals success.

It appears that towards the end of the bubble, regular buyers started to pull out of the market while investors were still rushing in." https://www.movesmartly.com/lessons-learned-from-toronto-2017-real-estate-bubble
