title: Actually, Rent Control Is Great
---

In April, the government of Ontario decided to extend rent control to every dwelling in the province, as opposed to just buildings constructed before 1991.

Different jurisdictions have overlapping definitions of "rent control", but, basically Ontario engages in what some regions call "rent stabilization" and some academics call "second-generation rent control". It works like this: everyone's rent is now subject to a price control. Throughout the duration of your tenancy, your landlord cannot raise your monthly rent beyond a threshold pegged to inflation. Between tenants, landlords are free to price rents at whatever the market will bear.

A [lot of people](http://tvo.org/article/current-affairs/the-next-ontario/ontario-needs-a-rental-rethink-but-should-tread-carefully) [decided](http://nationalpost.com/news/toronto/chris-selley-rent-control-is-a-bad-solution-to-the-wrong-problem/wcm/b9dc401c-0918-4099-9967-659d0534d815) [this was](https://www.thestar.com/business/2017/04/18/tougher-rent-control-in-ontario-puts-new-supply-at-risk-say-owners.html) [a bad idea](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/rent-control-isnt-the-solution-to-ontarios-housing-problem/article34753102/), and [their argument](http://www.torontosun.com/2017/04/15/rent-controls-wrong-answer-to-housing-crisis) is easy to restate:  [econ 101 predicts it will restrict the supply](https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2015/08/economist-explains-19) of purpose built rentals. Remove the profit incentive and in the long run price controls will harm renters via a reduction in supply, QED.

This culminated in a report on the [state of the condo market by Urbanation](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/real-estate/toronto/toronto-condo-rental-market-soars-on-heels-of-new-measures/article35585753/), released in July: though supply went up, average rents have grown by an eye popping 11% and there are no vacancies in the system. The culprit, clearly, are the new rent control measures:

>“The message here is that we’re grossly under-building rentals and the rent control measures that were introduced are going to make it worse over time through less supply and less turnover,” said Shaun Hildebrand, senior vice-president of Urbanation.

This makes me sad, because I find these arguments to be unconvincing if not occasionally facetious or disingenuous.

The rent stabilization measures introduced by the province are, by any cold blooded analysis, actually rather tame; and while I can't blame industry for acting in its self interest, I do wish commentators used a little more imagination before criticizing it. 


The reasons are simple: rent stabilization as we know it is a necessary measure for the public good, and the world we inhabit only superficially resembles econ 101. 

It's time more people within urbanist circles defended measures like these.

<h3>Making the case for rent stabilization</h3>

Regulating land and its uses &mdash; what to build and where and how &mdash; is one of the most basic and foundational tasks of the state. Property rights, as granted and protected by our governments, are limited to the extent they interfere with the rights and legitimate interests of others. What we describe as a market in real estate did not emerge fully formed but is instead the result of many deliberate decisions made over time. 

This is to say: what, exactly, should be the goal of our housing system? and, consequently, what kind of living conditions do we want people to enjoy? I think that we can all agree that, though obviously necessary to some extent, our property regime ought not be _solely_ organized around maximizing the profits of incumbent property owners. 

It seems clear to me that, given a choice, we should instead optimize our housing system as a whole to deliver and sustain healthy, well functioning communities that support our citizens as they age and transition through different lifecycles, and as economic opportunities shift. Otherwise, what's the point?

This is to say, the goal of our housing markets should be that of delivering and sustaining healthy, well functioning communities that support our citizens as economic opportunities change and shift and people age and transition through different lifecyles.

Communities consist of both physical infrastructure, like roads and public transit, as well as "human" infrastructure, like community organizations and loose neighbourhood ties. A neighbourhood may be desirable for its proximity to a grocery store &mdash; but also for the quality of its schools, the absence of crime and the vitality of its community events.

Provided only with permanently precarious rental housing, tenants are strongly disincentivized from fully investing and participating in their communities. At the same time, tenants are routinely discounted or ignored by our political structures, and face greater hardships accessing necessary social services and economic opportunities.

Furthermore, regular rent evictions &mdash; whereby tenants are forced to leave their dwellings due to unaffordable increases in the cost of rent &mdash; can tear away at the fabric of neighbourhoods. I recently read Matthew Desmond's incredible and harrowing book "Eviction," in which he followed several low-income renters in the city of Milwaukee over the course of a year. On page 70, he quotes Jane Jacobs' "The Death and Life of American Cities":

> "The first thing to understand is that the public peace&mdash;the sidewalk and street peace&mdash;of cities is not kept primarily by the police, necessary as police are. It is kept primarily by an intricate, almost unconscious, network of voluntary controls and standards among the people themselves, and enforced by the people themselves."

Desmond continues, and writes:

> [Jane Jacobs] has been proved right: disadvantaged neighborhoods with higher levels of "collective efficacy"&mdash;the stuff of loosely linked neighbors who trust one another and share expectations about how to make their community better&mdash;have lower crime rates.

>A single eviction could destabilize multiple city blocks, not only the block from which a family was evicted but also the block to which it begrudgingly relocated. In this way, displacement contributed directly to what Jacobs called "perpetual slums," churning environments with high rates of turnover and even higher rates of resentment and divestment. "The key link in a perpetual slum is that too many people move out of it too fast&mdash;and in the meantime _dream_ of getting out"

In that light, it's in the public interest that our citizens be provided with housing stability and, by definition, we can only really be achieve this by providing people with steady and predictable housing costs. 


Could a well supplied market alone deliver this outcome? If you can find a similarly priced apartment elsewhere, your landlord may be less inclined to raise your rent. However, this ignores both the asymmetry in moving costs and the substantial regional variation in amenities and infrastructure.

Consider that, in the absence of measures like rent stabilization, landlords are strongly incentivized to cash in on new or improved local amenities subsidized or provided by the state or the local community itself. Has a new LRT stop opened up nearby? Is the neighbourhood now a safer place to live? Time to increase rents! 

Consider further that there are substantial asymmetries in who can enjoy which infrastructure or amenities. For instance, the Parkdale neighourhood in Toronto hosts a significant Tibetan ethnic enclave, which in of itself may be insignificant to you or me &mdash; but if you're a recent Tibetan immigrant, residing near or within your ethnic enclave has a substantial impact on your job prospects, your social life and your ability to integrate.

In my opinion, leaving tenants in a position where they may reasonably fear the amelioration of their own communities is a perverse and wicked outcome.

(Those of you, in the back, shouting about land value taxation: yes, I agree but one thing at a time.)

  <h3>How it kind of used to work</h3>

  In the post-war era, back when land was abundant, interest rates were high and inflation rates did not flirt with the zero-bound, different levels of Canadian governments delivered stable and predictable housing costs through a mix of encouraging and subsidizing home ownership, subsidizing purpose built rental housing, and the large scale construction of rent geared to income social housing. In fact, from 1965 to 1995, up to 10% of all new housing in Canada was social housing. 

  This system is now broken. Our social housing programs were gutted in the '90s, leading to their present day deterioration. Meanwhile, post-Great Recesssion global economic conditions, in addition to unearned returns on equity for existing homeowners, have inflated housing prices beyond the reach of most young, middle and low income people. 
-->

Today, half of the population of the city of Toronto rents their housing, and home-ownership is out of reach for the young and those with middle and low incomes. Why should they be subjected to a tenancy regime that significantly disadvantages them socially, economically and politically compared to the (government subsidized) homeowning population?

The moral argument for rent stabilization is simple: tenants deserve to, and the proper functioning of our cities requires that they, be allowed to invest and fully participate in their communities. Long term tenants have a legitimate interest in staying in the communities they themselves have made successful. And, in isolation, even idealized, perfectly supplied markets cannot prevent their costly dislocation and destabilization.


<h3>Making the <i>economic</i> case for rent stabilization</h3>

This is all fine and dandy, but, what about the lack of supply in our housing market? Rent stabilization is great for the people who already live here, but we should also think about newcomers. 

In isolation, the profit disincentive will decrease the marginal quantity of newly developed housing, and therefore reduce our total housing supply. If our housing system is to respond adequately to increased demand, then we should not be erecting barriers to new construction. People don't stay put forever, and there will come a time when they will want to move for perfectly voluntary reasons. Surely, over the long run, won't the lack of housing supply cause more harm?

Well... that may be true. It's hard to say, 

That said, things don't work in isolation. 

However, things aren't all the same. Housing supply is extremely inelastic and housing production

There are many issues at play here. To begin, measures like rent stabilization do not exist in a vaccum. It is simply incorrect to 

 
They're unimaginative because though the costs are concentrated and easy to measure, the benefits stand to be much larger, if diffusely distributed. They're Disingenuous, because 


because in their zeal to protect margins industry participants will happily muddy the waters; after all, Urbanation's [report from _January_](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/real-estate/toronto/torontos-hot-housing-market-spills-over-to-condo-rentals/article33627170/) had identical conclusions: rents are up by 11% and there are no vacancies in the system.



I believe rent stabilization is a public good, and rent stabilization is _necessary_. It's time more people within urbanist circles defended these measures.

To begin, ask yourself this: what exactly is the point of our housing system? and, what kind of living conditions do we want people to have?

Consider that predictable and stable housing costs are a prerequisite for well-functioning communities. In the absence of stability, tenants cannot invest in their neighbourhoods and fully participate as civic actors. Well-functioning communities provide services for their 

Rent evictions tear away at the fabric of local communities and, in so far that they're enforced by the state, directly waste our tax dollars for private gain.

Rent evictions hit low-income workers the hardest, and invariably displaces them towards lower-amenity and less desireable locations. 

Applied to the entire region at once, and in so far that they reduce total rent-extraction, I would even argue that in the long run measures like rent stabilization are probably _more_ economically efficient. Housing, in the economic sense, is a terribly unproductive thing to be diverting our resources towards. Why we should reward property owners with higher returns due to investments made by the state (via public services) or by local residents (via community groups)?

(Yes, land value taxes are probably best. Insert an argument for them here.)

To create and sustain a housing market where neighbourhoods can be disrupted and long-time tenants can be kicked out on a whim has very obvious and measurable consequences on people's health, income earning potential and the functioning of our civic society. It is unjust, not to mention also penny-wise-and-pound-foolish.

It is fine and appropriate to note that tenants are harmed by the absence of rental supply. In a vaccum, rent stabilization clearly acts as a disincentive, given how it lowers profit margins. How can we address this? Land and its use is one of the most well-regulated aspects of our society. It's insufficient


Rent evictions tear away at the fabric of neighbourhoods and in so far that they're enforced by the state, cost the government money.

The dual-class system we used to inhabit &mdash; whereby only homeowners got to enjoy predictable and stable housing costs &mdash; was outrageously unfair. 

Furthermore, in the long run rent stabilization is more economically efficient: 


The Toronto housing crisis is a complicated and deep topic. Like many other complex systems, the failure of our housing system is overdeterminedand, when discussing Toronto's lack of cheap and affordable housing, there exists a rich variety of causal narratives to pick from.

However, useful _goals_ of our housing system are easy to discuss. When we talk about the housing crisis, we are concerned with two things: whether our city can grow (economically, productively, population wise, etc), and whether our communities can thrive. Furthermore, you can't have one without the other. This is almost a trite tautology, but it's worth restating: without growth, our communities will stagnate and whither away and, without functioning communities providing pleasant places to live, we heavily restrict or destroy entirely the growth we're able to experience.

Let's restate that yet again. Cities are the economic engines of our service-based economy. Cities have captured most of the growth and the productivity gains in recent decades because higher population densities allow for economies of scale and yield higher returns on quote unquote "innovation". At the same time, high skill, high value-add industries require a whole ecosystem of medium and low skill industries. Someone has to clean our offices, cook our food and look after our kids. Someone has to teach those kids, build buildings and look after the elderly.

To prevent newcomers from living in our city is to spite prosperity; to turn around and push out everyone who makes a city _work_ is to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs.


Recently, Urbanation released a [report on conditions in the Toronto condo rental market](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/real-estate/toronto/torontos-hot-housing-market-spills-over-to-condo-rentals/article33627170/), and the picture ain't good: though supply is up, rental prices have grown by an eye popping 11% and there are no vacancies in the system. They blame this on rent control measures re-introduced by the government of Ontario in April of this year.

This is disingenuous of them, and I wish they would reconsider. Their methodology is suspect; the recency of these measures renders their conclusion void; but most damningly I think is simply that the numbers are identical from their _january_ report. A mere six months ago rents were up 11%, and there were no vacancies in the system. To be pedantic, it's barely even news if in fact, according to Urbanation, rents have gone up 11% per year on average for the past twelve years.





The Toronto housing crisis is a rich, complex topic but it can ultimately be boiled down to two concerns: we must ensure the city can continue to grow, and we must ensure that our communities can thrive.

It may not seem obvious, but in the absence of growth our communities will not whither; and the absence of thriving communities will prevent our city can continue to grow.

Recently, Urbanation released a [report on conditions in the Toronto condo rental market](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/real-estate/toronto/torontos-hot-housing-market-spills-over-to-condo-rentals/article33627170/), and the picture ain't good: though supply is up, rental prices have grown by an eye popping 11% and there are no vacancies in the system. They blame this on rent control measures re-introduced by the government of Ontario in April of this year.

This was annoying to me, because a careful examination reveals it to be specious. We could talk about its methodological flaws, or how these measures simply haven't been around long enough to study their impact. For our purposes, suffice it to say that [Urbanation's _January_ report](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/real-estate/toronto/torontos-hot-housing-market-spills-over-to-condo-rentals/article33627170/) had identical conclusions: rents are up by 11%, there are no vacancies in the system. In fact, rents have been [going up by 11% on average](https://www.urbanation.ca/news/181-rental-demand-reaches-record-high-following-new-housing-rules) _since 2005_.

In short, this is a crappy outcome but it isn't really about rent control. The Toronto rental and real estate markets, due to a combination of outdated land use regulations and historically low interest rates, have been irrationally exuberant for a little over a decade and lately have become poised to radically alter the social fabric of the city.

Everyone's a [rent control](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/rent-control-isnt-the-solution-to-ontarios-housing-problem/article34753102/) [skeptic](http://tvo.org/article/current-affairs/the-next-ontario/ontario-needs-a-rental-rethink-but-should-tread-carefully) and the case against it is easy to make: [econ 101 predicts it will restrict the supply](https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2015/08/economist-explains-19) of purpose-built rental buildings. But that's only half the picture, and for all our sake we should strive to move beyond econ 101. Rent control is good, and it is necessary.

It's in this context that I would like to defend rent control, and specifically, rent stabilization: the notion that, once you've taken up residency, your housing costs should roughly track inflation.

My argument is simple: if we don't provide people with a baseline security of tenancy, we can't make cities the livable, pleasant and super-productive places we want them to be. Absent 

Stable housing costs are important because without them we cannot ensure security of tenancy.
