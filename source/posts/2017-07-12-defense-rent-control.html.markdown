title: In Defense of Rent Control
---

The Toronto housing crisis is a complicated and deep topic. Like many other complex systems, the failure of our housing system is overdeterminedand, when discussing Toronto's lack of cheap and affordable housing, there exists a rich variety of causal narratives to pick from.

However, useful _goals_ of our housing system are easy to discuss. When we talk about the housing crisis, we are concerned with two things: whether our city can grow (economically, productively, population wise, etc), and whether our communities can thrive. Furthermore, you can't have one without the other. This is almost a trite tautology, but it's worth restating: without growth, our communities will stagnate and whither away and, without functioning communities providing pleasant places to live, we heavily restrict or destroy entirely the growth we're able to experience.

Let's restate that yet again. Cities are the economic engines of our service-based economy. Cities have captured most of the growth and the productivity gains in recent decades because higher population densities allow for economies of scale and yield higher returns on quote unquote "innovation". At the same time, high skill, high value-add industries require a whole ecosystem of medium and low skill industries. Someone has to clean our offices, cook our food and look after our kids. Someone has to teach those kids, build buildings and look after the elderly.

To prevent newcomers from living in our city is to spite prosperity; to turn around and push out everyone who makes a city _work_ is to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs.


Recently, Urbanation released a [report on conditions in the Toronto condo rental market](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/real-estate/toronto/torontos-hot-housing-market-spills-over-to-condo-rentals/article33627170/), and the picture ain't good: though supply is up, rental prices have grown by an eye popping 11% and there are no vacancies in the system. They blame this on rent control measures re-introduced by the government of Ontario in April of this year.

This is disingenuous of them, and I wish they would reconsider. Their methodology is suspect; the recency of these measures renders their conclusion void; but most damningly I think is simply that the numbers are identical from their _january_ report. A mere six months ago rents were up 11%, and there were no vacancies in the system. To be pedantic, it's barely even news if in fact, according to Urbanation, rents have gone up 11% per year on average for the past twelve years.





The Toronto housing crisis is a rich, complex topic but it can ultimately be boiled down to two concerns: we must ensure the city can continue to grow, and we must ensure that our communities can thrive.

It may not seem obvious, but in the absence of growth our communities will not whither; and the absence of thriving communities will prevent our city can continue to grow.

They blame this on rent control measures re-introduced by the government of Ontario in April of this year.

This was annoying to me, because a careful examination reveals it to be specious. We could talk about its methodological flaws, or how these measures simply haven't been around long enough to study their impact. For our purposes, suffice it to say that [Urbanation's _January_ report](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/real-estate/toronto/torontos-hot-housing-market-spills-over-to-condo-rentals/article33627170/) had identical conclusions: rents are up by 11%, there are no vacancies in the system. In fact, rents have been [going up by 11% on average](https://www.urbanation.ca/news/181-rental-demand-reaches-record-high-following-new-housing-rules) _since 2005_.

In short, this is a crappy outcome but it isn't really about rent control. The Toronto rental and real estate markets, due to a combination of outdated land use regulations and historically low interest rates, have been irrationally exuberant for a little over a decade and lately have become poised to radically alter the social fabric of the city.

Everyone's a [rent control](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/rent-control-isnt-the-solution-to-ontarios-housing-problem/article34753102/) [skeptic](http://tvo.org/article/current-affairs/the-next-ontario/ontario-needs-a-rental-rethink-but-should-tread-carefully) and the case against it is easy to make: [econ 101 predicts it will restrict the supply](https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2015/08/economist-explains-19) of purpose-built rental buildings. But that's only half the picture, and for all our sake we should strive to move beyond econ 101. Rent control is good, and it is necessary.

It's in this context that I would like to defend rent control, and specifically, rent stabilization: the notion that, once you've taken up residency, your housing costs should roughly track inflation.

My argument is simple: if we don't provide people with a baseline security of tenancy, we can't make cities the livable, pleasant and super-productive places we want them to be. Absent 

Stable housing costs are important because without them we cannot ensure security of tenancy.
