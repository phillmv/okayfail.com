title: Actually, Rent Control Is Great
draft: true
---

In April, the government of Ontario decided to extend rent control to every dwelling in the province, as opposed to just buildings constructed before 1991.

Different jurisdictions have overlapping definitions of "rent control". What Ontario engages in is described by some academics as a vacancy decontrolled second-generation rent control, and some regions call "rent stabilization". It works like this: everyone's rent is now subject to a price control. Throughout the duration of your tenancy, your landlord can only raise your monthly rent according to a threshold pegged to inflation, and to recover capital expenditures. Between tenants, landlords are free to price rents at whatever the market will bear.

A [lot of people](http://tvo.org/article/current-affairs/the-next-ontario/ontario-needs-a-rental-rethink-but-should-tread-carefully) [decided](http://nationalpost.com/news/toronto/chris-selley-rent-control-is-a-bad-solution-to-the-wrong-problem/wcm/b9dc401c-0918-4099-9967-659d0534d815) [this was](https://www.thestar.com/business/2017/04/18/tougher-rent-control-in-ontario-puts-new-supply-at-risk-say-owners.html) [a bad idea](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/rent-control-isnt-the-solution-to-ontarios-housing-problem/article34753102/), and [their argument](http://www.torontosun.com/2017/04/15/rent-controls-wrong-answer-to-housing-crisis) is [easy to restate](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/real-estate/toronto/new-ontario-rent-control-rules-exact-opposite-of-what-is-needed-analyst-warns/article34569276/):  [econ 101 predicts it will restrict the supply](https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2015/08/economist-explains-19) of purpose built rentals. Remove the profit incentive and in the long run price controls will harm renters via a reduction in supply, QED.

This culminated in a report on the [state of the condo market by Urbanation](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/real-estate/toronto/toronto-condo-rental-market-soars-on-heels-of-new-measures/article35585753/), released in July: though supply went up, average rents have grown by an eye popping 11% and there are no vacancies in the system. The culprit, clearly, are the new rent control measures:

>“The message here is that we’re grossly under-building rentals and the rent control measures that were introduced are going to make it worse over time through less supply and less turnover,” said Shaun Hildebrand, senior vice-president of Urbanation.

This makes me sad, because I find these arguments range from the unconvincing to the disingenuous. I can't blame industry for acting in its self interest, but I do wish commentators employed a little more imagination and critical thinking. 

The reason is simple: rent stabilization, like many other kinds of regulation, is a response to _market failure_. And, crucially, the experience of the past twenty years shows that rent stabilization is not the primary disincentive delaying supply from the market.

Our housing delivery system is complex. We regulate our housing markets in order to correct market inefficiencies, to prevent people from being exploited, and to change incentive structures to deliver outcomes we have deemed necessary or correct. We also significantly intervene, subsidize and shape the funding and price mechanism through which new housing is produced.

If the profit incentive alone were able to provide us with ample supply, moderate vacancy rates, and affordable and dignified living conditions, we wouldn't find the need to regulate and intervene to the extent that we do. 

It's not enough to look at any one piece of this in isolation. Let's examine the broader context.

<!--
When we regulate rents, our purpose is to preserve the security of tenure of our residents. In a well-functioning rental market, with ample supply and moderate vacancy rates, landlords lack the market power to gouge tenants and rent increases closely track inflation. However, our rental markets do not function properly; supply is contrained and vacancy rates are at all-time lows.

In this article, I will be examining the historical context we occupy, the reasons and ways in which we do regulate the housing market, and finally the state and economics 

In a well-functioning rental market, we probably wouldn't need rent controls. With ample supply and moderate vacancy rates, landlords would lack the market power to gouge and discriminate against tenants, and rent prices would closely track inflation. 

Instead, supply is constrained and vacancy rates are at all-time lows &mdash; and tenants face significant risks of undergoing an "economic eviction". Cities like Toronto are in the midst of a housing crisis, and, frankly, Ontario's residential rental market has been in one state of failure or another for well over thirty years.[^market-failure] In addition, as we will see later, the economics of purpose built rental buildings are negatively impacted by a wide variety of factors.

First, let us consider the context in which we operate.
-->


<h3>A Brief History of Housing in Canada</h3>

Property rights and the markets they enable exist to the extent they are enforced and protected by the state. When we establish and regulate rights, we typically seek to balance the interests and concerns of everyone involved, and revisit those tradeoffs as our values and goals shift over time. We think our food should be safe to eat, our doctors should be well trained, and that you shouldn't dump waste anywhere you feel like.

In Canada, it would be difficult to identify a time when we had a completely laissez faire housing market. Some of our earliest municipal bylaws regulated building standards. First, we sought to improve our health, safety, fire and construction standards, and later we gradually began to add a host of land use and development regulations.[^hulchanksi-laissez]

These regulations led to the elimination of unhealthy, unsafe and poor quality housing in urban areas. However, our improved housing standards (and restrictions on land use) led to an increase in the cost of its manufacture, and by 1914 it became apparent that the private market alone was not providing enough low income housing.[^hulchanksi-laissez] 

One intervention begat another. Federal incentives were introduced as early as 1938 to stimulate the development of low income rental housing, and by 1949 the government began to invest directly in its production.[^hulchanksi-laissez] Buoyed by the post-war economic and population boom,  we began to seriously expand our welfare state and, concerned with ensuring "enough rental housing production to nourish the golden goose of urban growth", from 1965 to 1995 up to 10% of all new housing was some mix of social housing.[^suttor-abriged]

These interventions were not limited to the poor; quite the opposite. In 1946, the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) was established with the aim of increasing home ownership among the broad middle and lower-middle class. Focussing mainly on making amortized mortgages work for house buyers and private investors in rental housing, by the mid-1960s most households obtained at least part of their mortgage loan directly from the federal government.[^hulchansky-bulletin38]

In fact, most of the history of the role of Canadian government housing policy is an effort to assist ownership. In 2005 alone, more individual homeowners were helped through mortgage insurance than the number of all social housing units funded since the 1970s. And in addition to creating cheaper loans, the federal government also provides subsidies through a variety of tax credits, tax sheltered investment vehicles and tax exemptions. As any property owner knows, the sale of your primary residence is exempt from capital gains &mdash; which by 2008 was costing us almost $6 billion a year in uncollected revenue.[^hulchansky-bulletin38]

In so far that our housing policy has targetted the middle class' standard of living, it has been rather successful. As an investment asset, home ownership confers unique benefits: it provides shelter in addition to equity that can be withdrawn later in life. Canadians who pay off their mortgages spend on average only 11% of their income on housing and, by 1999, the average homeowner earned 208% more income, and owned 70 times more wealth, than the average tenant.[^hulchansky-bulletin38]

<!--Regulating land and its use &mdash; what to build and where and how &mdash; is one of the foundational tasks of the state. Some of the earliest municipal bylaws regulate building standards. Over time, we've sought to improve the health, safety, fire and construction standards of our housing and then 

Indeed, in Canada it's difficult to identify any period of laissez-faire housing market; some of the earliest municipal bylaws sought to regulate building standards.

Property rights, as granted and protected by our governments, are limited to the extent they interfere with the rights and legitimate interests of others. What we describe as a market in real estate did not emerge fully formed but is instead the result of many deliberate decisions made over time. -->

<h2>Making the moral case for rent stabilization</h2>

This is to say: what kind of living conditions do we want people to enjoy? and consequently, what, exactly, should be the goal of our housing system? have been considered important questions for over a century &mdash; and our answers to these questions have shifted over time. We began by regulating the safety of our housing, and today we significantly subsidize its ownership for those who can afford it. 

Similarly, our perception of the nature of the relationship between property owners and tenants has also shifted.

Under common law, which concerned itself with a leaseholder's (agricultural) relationship to the land, a landlord was under no statutory requirement to maintain the premises or conduct any repairs &mdash; nor were there any limits on their power to evict or even seize the property of tenants. A review of the applicable laws in 1968 found that landlords possessed such a disparity of bargaining power that tenants did not have a freedom of contract in any real sense.[^hulchanksi-tenant-rights]

It became clear that tenants deserved protection for a variety of ethical, legal and economic reasons, and that applying old-school land law principles to the modern urban apartment rental was totally unsuitable. Gradually the law caught up: Ontario adopted its first residential protection laws in 1970, while the notion that tenants deserve security of tenure was added by 1975. Today, landlords are seen as responsible for providing safe and livable accomodations, and that tenants should be protected from arbitrary evictions.[^yee-1989]

Typically, this is framed as a conflict of self-interests between landlords and tenants; tenants suffer disproportionate costs when forced to move, and benefit from stability. But security of tenure doesn't just benefit individual tenants. The stability provided by security of tenure is the stuff from which well functioning communities are made of, and in that view, security of tenure is a public good.


<!--This is to say: what, exactly, should be the goal of our housing system? and, consequently, what kind of living conditions do we want people to enjoy? 

I think that we can all agree that, though obviously necessary to some extent, our property regime ought not be _solely_ organized around maximizing the profits of incumbent property owners. 

It seems clear to me that, given a choice, we should instead optimize our housing system as a whole to deliver and sustain healthy, well functioning communities that support our citizens as they age and transition through different lifecycles. Otherwise, what's the point?

Let's take this for granted. What's a well functioning community?-->

Our communities consist of both physical infrastructure, like roads and public transit, as well as "human" infrastructure, like community organizations and loose neighbourhood ties. A neighbourhood may be desirable for its proximity to a grocery store &mdash; but also for the quality of its schools, the absence of crime and the vitality of its community events. A healthy neighbourhood is one where its residents are looking out for one another.

Tenants face substantial hurdles. I recently read Matthew Desmond's incredible and harrowing book "Eviction," in which he followed several low-income renters in the city of Milwaukee over the course of a year. Early on, he writes:

> "The public peace&mdash;the sidewalk and street peace&mdash;of cities is not kept primarily by the police, necessary as police are. It is kept primarily by an intricate, almost unconscious, network of voluntary controls and standards among the people themselves, and enforced by the people themselves." So wrote Jane Jacobs in _The Death and Life of Great American Cities_. Jacobs believed that a prerequisite for this type of healthy and engaged community was the presence of people who were simply present, who looked after the neighborhood.  She has been proved right: disadvantaged neighborhoods with higher levels of "collective efficacy"&mdash;the stuff of loosely linked neighbors who trust one another and share expectations about how to make their community better&mdash;have lower crime rates.

<!-- >A single eviction could destabilize multiple city blocks, not only the block from which a family was evicted but also the block to which it begrudgingly relocated. In this way, displacement contributed directly to what Jacobs called "perpetual slums," churning environments with high rates of turnover and even higher rates of resentment and divestment. -->



Towards the end of the book, he adds:

> Residential stability begets a kind of psychological stability, which allows people to invest in their home and social relationships. It begets school stability, which increases the chances that children will excel and graduate. And it begets community stability, which encourages neighbours to form strong bonds and take care of their block. But poor families enjoy little of that because they are evicted at such high rates. 

> [...]

> Eviction even affects the communities that displaced families leave behind. Neighbors who cooperate with and trust one another can make their streets safer and more prosperous. But that takes time. Efforts to establish local cohesion and community investment are thwarted in neighborhoods with high turnover rates. In this way, eviction can unravel the fabric of a community, helping to ensure that neighbors remain strangers and that their collective capacity to combat crime and promote civic engagement remains untapped.[^desmond]

Faced with the unpredictable but certain need to move in the near future, it's harder to establish deep ties to an neighbourhood. As a result, tenants are routinely discounted or ignored by our political structures, and face greater hardships accessing necessary social services and economic opportunities.

In addition, landlords are also strongly incentivized to cash in on new or improved local amenities provided either by the state or the local community itself. The reduction of crime, or the expansion of public transit, readily provide rationales for increasing rents. Creating conditions where tenants may reasonably fear the amelioration of their communities is a rather perverse outcome.[^lvt]

For these reasons, it's necessary to distinguish protecting the moral rights of existing, long term tenants from the problem of affordabiliy and supply.[^psmag] If the market is unable to sustain tenants' security of tenure, then we should find other ways to provide it.

Every regulation imposes tradeoffs, and the regulation of rent should be seen as not unlike that of the regulation of fire safety. Mandating that landlords' properties satisfy certain minimum fire safety standards also raises costs and diminishes the affordability of housing. Though some [are happy make that macabre argument](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-06-16/beware-of-blaming-government-for-london-tower-fire), by and large we've decided it's a cost worth bearing. At some point, we will always be dealing with thresholds and equilibriums, and it is up to society to decide what is or isn't acceptable.


<!--
In that light, it's in the public interest that our citizens be provided with housing stability.  In principle, this could be delivered by a well supplied market.  If you can find a similarly priced apartment elsewhere, your landlord may be less inclined to raise your rent. But, in its absence, we must find other ways of guaranteeing these conditions.



Could a well supplied market alone deliver this outcome? If you can find a similarly priced apartment elsewhere, your landlord may be less inclined to raise your rent. However, this ignores the substantial regional variation in amenities and infrastructure over time.

Consider that, in the absence of measures like rent stabilization, landlords are strongly incentivized to cash in on new or improved local amenities provided by the state or the local community itself. Has a new LRT stop opened up nearby? Is the neighbourhood now a safer place to live? Time to increase rents! 

Consider further that there are substantial asymmetries in who can enjoy which infrastructure or amenities. For instance, the Parkdale neighourhood in Toronto hosts a significant Tibetan ethnic enclave, which in of itself may be insignificant to you or me &mdash; but if you're a recent Tibetan immigrant, residing near or within your ethnic enclave has a substantial impact on your job prospects, your social life and your ability to integrate with society at large.

In my opinion, leaving tenants in a position where they may reasonably fear the amelioration of their own communities is a perverse and wicked outcome.

(Those of you, in the back, shouting about land value taxation: yes, I agree but one thing at a time.)-->

<!--
  <h3>How it kind of used to work</h3>

  In the post-war era, back when land was abundant, interest rates were high and inflation rates did not flirt with the zero-bound, different levels of Canadian governments delivered stable and predictable housing costs through a mix of encouraging and subsidizing home ownership, subsidizing purpose built rental housing, and the large scale construction of rent geared to income social housing. In fact, from 1965 to 1995, up to 10% of all new housing in Canada was social housing. 

  This system is now broken. Our social housing programs were gutted in the '90s, leading to their present day deterioration. Meanwhile, post-Great Recesssion global economic conditions, in addition to unearned returns on equity for existing homeowners, have inflated housing prices beyond the reach of most young, middle and low income people. 
-->

In 2011, a little under half of the population of the city of Toronto rents their housing,[^census-2011] and home-ownership is out of reach for the young and those with middle and low incomes.[^cbc-squeeze] Long term tenants have a legitimate interest in staying in the communities they themselves have made successful. Why should they be subjected to a tenure regime that significantly disadvantages them socially, economically and politically compared to the (government subsidized) homeowning population?

<h2>Making the economic case for rent stabilization</h2>

This is all fine, but it doesn't address the main criticism: what about the lack of supply in our housing market?

While the social benefits are hard to value, the cost of a tight housing market is all too readily apparent. The counter argument goes something like this. In isolation, adding disincentives like rent stabilization will decrease the marginal quantity of newly developed rental housing, and therefore reduce our total housing supply and exacerbate market rents. If our housing system is to respond adequately to increased demand, then we should not be erecting barriers to new construction. 

Rent stabilization is great for the people who already live here, but it won't preserve affordability for newcomers. People don't stay put forever, and there will come a time when they will want to move for perfectly voluntary reasons &mdash; upon which they'll be subject to market rents once again. Rent stabilization, then, encourages people to stay put and exacerbates the problem of affordability in the first place.

This view in of itself is unobjectionable. In isolation, and all other things remaining the same, if I'm looking to make an investment I'm obviously going to be motivated by my returns &mdash; and policies that affect those profit margins are going to make investments like rental housing less attractive.

Well, in Ontario rent increases in newly constructed buildings were deregulated for about twenty five years. What has happened to our supply?

<!--
Of course, this ignores the social benefits of such a policy. After all, every regulation imposes tradeoffs, and you can construct similar arguments around any other regulation that seeks to protect tenants. 

For example, mandating that landlords keep certain minimum fire safety standards also raises costs, and lowers margins, with similar attendant effects. Though some will [happily make that macabre argument](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-06-16/beware-of-blaming-government-for-london-tower-fire), by and large we've decided it's a cost worth bearing. At some point, we will always be dealing with thresholds and equilibriums, and it is up to society to decide what is or isn't acceptable.

As a result, it's necessary to distinguish the preservation of affordability, as a policy, from the creation of new supply. However, let's engage with this argument. What _has_ happened to our rental supply? -->

<h3>The case of the vanishing rental supply</h3>

When we talk about rental supply, we typically distinguish between the "primary" rental market, where professional landlords operate purpose built rental buildings, and the "secondary" rental market, where individuals rent out their basement apartments or spare condos.

We typically favour primary rentals because only landlords that operate at scale can provide long-term accomodation &mdash; condos have a tendency to get sold &mdash; and are more capable of absorbing maintenance costs.

In a bid to stimulate new purpose built rental construction, rent stabilization for new buildings in Ontario was first loosened in 1992, and then removed altogether in 1998.[^rent-control-city-report]

In Toronto, what have we built since then?

<figure>
<a href="/img/Toronto Housing Completions 1981-2016 - bar chart.png"><img src="/img/Toronto Housing Completions 1981-2016 - bar chart.png"></a>
</figure>

The difference stands out more when we change the graph type:

<figure>
<a href="/img/Toronto Housing Completions 1981-2016 - 100pc stacked bar chart.png"><img src="/img/Toronto Housing Completions 1981-2016 - 100pc stacked bar chart.png"></a>
</figure>

From 1981 to 1997, we averaged 2,836 new primary rental units per year. By 1998, we virtually ceased production and from 2000-2016 we averaged a mere 880 new rental units per year.  

For over twenty years we've lived in a regime without rent stabilization. If rent stabilization were the primary disincentive, surely we'd expect to see the opposite. What happened?

It's important to recognize that the Canadian housing market does not work in isolation. As discussed above, the government intervenes and subsidizes it at many different levels. 

If we want to talk about just private purpose built rentals, the above graph actually understates the problem: a majority of the rentals built from 1981-1997 are in fact social housing. The spike we see in 1993-1996 is actually the dying gasp of our federal and provincial social housing programs - killed in 1993 and 1995 respectively.[^suttor-abriged]

There are many issues at play here. To begin, measures like rent stabilization do not exist in a vaccum. It is simply incorrect to 

 
They're unimaginative because though the costs are concentrated and easy to measure, the benefits stand to be much larger, if diffusely distributed. They're Disingenuous, because 


because in their zeal to protect margins industry participants will happily muddy the waters; after all, Urbanation's [report from _January_](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/real-estate/toronto/torontos-hot-housing-market-spills-over-to-condo-rentals/article33627170/) had identical conclusions: rents are up by 11% and there are no vacancies in the system.



I believe rent stabilization is a public good, and rent stabilization is _necessary_. It's time more people within urbanist circles defended these measures.

To begin, ask yourself this: what exactly is the point of our housing system? and, what kind of living conditions do we want people to have?

Consider that predictable and stable housing costs are a prerequisite for well-functioning communities. In the absence of stability, tenants cannot invest in their neighbourhoods and fully participate as civic actors. Well-functioning communities provide services for their 

Rent evictions tear away at the fabric of local communities and, in so far that they're enforced by the state, directly waste our tax dollars for private gain.

Rent evictions hit low-income workers the hardest, and invariably displaces them towards lower-amenity and less desireable locations. 

Applied to the entire region at once, and in so far that they reduce total rent-extraction, I would even argue that in the long run measures like rent stabilization are probably _more_ economically efficient. Housing, in the economic sense, is a terribly unproductive thing to be diverting our resources towards. Why we should reward property owners with higher returns due to investments made by the state (via public services) or by local residents (via community groups)?

(Yes, land value taxes are probably best. Insert an argument for them here.)

To create and sustain a housing market where neighbourhoods can be disrupted and long-time tenants can be kicked out on a whim has very obvious and measurable consequences on people's health, income earning potential and the functioning of our civic society. It is unjust, not to mention also penny-wise-and-pound-foolish.

It is fine and appropriate to note that tenants are harmed by the absence of rental supply. In a vaccum, rent stabilization clearly acts as a disincentive, given how it lowers profit margins. How can we address this? Land and its use is one of the most well-regulated aspects of our society. It's insufficient


Rent evictions tear away at the fabric of neighbourhoods and in so far that they're enforced by the state, cost the government money.

The dual-class system we used to inhabit &mdash; whereby only homeowners got to enjoy predictable and stable housing costs &mdash; was outrageously unfair. 

Furthermore, in the long run rent stabilization is more economically efficient: 


The Toronto housing crisis is a complicated and deep topic. Like many other complex systems, the failure of our housing system is overdeterminedand, when discussing Toronto's lack of cheap and affordable housing, there exists a rich variety of causal narratives to pick from.

However, useful _goals_ of our housing system are easy to discuss. When we talk about the housing crisis, we are concerned with two things: whether our city can grow (economically, productively, population wise, etc), and whether our communities can thrive. Furthermore, you can't have one without the other. This is almost a trite tautology, but it's worth restating: without growth, our communities will stagnate and whither away and, without functioning communities providing pleasant places to live, we heavily restrict or destroy entirely the growth we're able to experience.

Let's restate that yet again. Cities are the economic engines of our service-based economy. Cities have captured most of the growth and the productivity gains in recent decades because higher population densities allow for economies of scale and yield higher returns on quote unquote "innovation". At the same time, high skill, high value-add industries require a whole ecosystem of medium and low skill industries. Someone has to clean our offices, cook our food and look after our kids. Someone has to teach those kids, build buildings and look after the elderly.

To prevent newcomers from living in our city is to spite prosperity; to turn around and push out everyone who makes a city _work_ is to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs.


Recently, Urbanation released a [report on conditions in the Toronto condo rental market](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/real-estate/toronto/torontos-hot-housing-market-spills-over-to-condo-rentals/article33627170/), and the picture ain't good: though supply is up, rental prices have grown by an eye popping 11% and there are no vacancies in the system. They blame this on rent control measures re-introduced by the government of Ontario in April of this year.

This is disingenuous of them, and I wish they would reconsider. Their methodology is suspect; the recency of these measures renders their conclusion void; but most damningly I think is simply that the numbers are identical from their _january_ report. A mere six months ago rents were up 11%, and there were no vacancies in the system. To be pedantic, it's barely even news if in fact, according to Urbanation, rents have gone up 11% per year on average for the past twelve years.





The Toronto housing crisis is a rich, complex topic but it can ultimately be boiled down to two concerns: we must ensure the city can continue to grow, and we must ensure that our communities can thrive.

It may not seem obvious, but in the absence of growth our communities will not whither; and the absence of thriving communities will prevent our city can continue to grow.

Recently, Urbanation released a [report on conditions in the Toronto condo rental market](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/real-estate/toronto/torontos-hot-housing-market-spills-over-to-condo-rentals/article33627170/), and the picture ain't good: though supply is up, rental prices have grown by an eye popping 11% and there are no vacancies in the system. They blame this on rent control measures re-introduced by the government of Ontario in April of this year.

This was annoying to me, because a careful examination reveals it to be specious. We could talk about its methodological flaws, or how these measures simply haven't been around long enough to study their impact. For our purposes, suffice it to say that [Urbanation's _January_ report](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/real-estate/toronto/torontos-hot-housing-market-spills-over-to-condo-rentals/article33627170/) had identical conclusions: rents are up by 11%, there are no vacancies in the system. In fact, rents have been [going up by 11% on average](https://www.urbanation.ca/news/181-rental-demand-reaches-record-high-following-new-housing-rules) _since 2005_.

In short, this is a crappy outcome but it isn't really about rent control. The Toronto rental and real estate markets, due to a combination of outdated land use regulations and historically low interest rates, have been irrationally exuberant for a little over a decade and lately have become poised to radically alter the social fabric of the city.

Everyone's a [rent control](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/rent-control-isnt-the-solution-to-ontarios-housing-problem/article34753102/) [skeptic](http://tvo.org/article/current-affairs/the-next-ontario/ontario-needs-a-rental-rethink-but-should-tread-carefully) and the case against it is easy to make: [econ 101 predicts it will restrict the supply](https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2015/08/economist-explains-19) of purpose-built rental buildings. But that's only half the picture, and for all our sake we should strive to move beyond econ 101. Rent control is good, and it is necessary.

It's in this context that I would like to defend rent control, and specifically, rent stabilization: the notion that, once you've taken up residency, your housing costs should roughly track inflation.

My argument is simple: if we don't provide people with a baseline security of tenancy, we can't make cities the livable, pleasant and super-productive places we want them to be. Absent 

Stable housing costs are important because without them we cannot ensure security of tenancy.
