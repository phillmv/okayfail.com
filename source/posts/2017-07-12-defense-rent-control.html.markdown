title: Actually, Rent Control Is Great
draft: true
---

In April, the government of Ontario decided to extend rent control to every dwelling in the province, as opposed to just buildings constructed before 1991.

Different jurisdictions have overlapping definitions of "rent control". What Ontario engages in is described by some academics and regions as a vacancy decontrolled second-generation rent control, or a tenancy rent control, or rent stabilization. It works like this: everyone's rent is now subject to a price control. Throughout the duration of your tenancy, your landlord can only raise your monthly rent according to a threshold pegged to inflation, and to recover capital expenditures. Between tenants, landlords are free to price rents at whatever the market will bear.

A [lot of people](http://tvo.org/article/current-affairs/the-next-ontario/ontario-needs-a-rental-rethink-but-should-tread-carefully) [decided](http://nationalpost.com/news/toronto/chris-selley-rent-control-is-a-bad-solution-to-the-wrong-problem/wcm/b9dc401c-0918-4099-9967-659d0534d815) [this was](https://www.thestar.com/business/2017/04/18/tougher-rent-control-in-ontario-puts-new-supply-at-risk-say-owners.html) [a bad idea](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/rent-control-isnt-the-solution-to-ontarios-housing-problem/article34753102/), and [their argument](http://www.torontosun.com/2017/04/15/rent-controls-wrong-answer-to-housing-crisis) is [easy to restate](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/real-estate/toronto/new-ontario-rent-control-rules-exact-opposite-of-what-is-needed-analyst-warns/article34569276/):  [econ 101 predicts it will restrict the supply](https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2015/08/economist-explains-19) of purpose built rentals. Remove the profit incentive and in the long run price controls will harm renters via a reduction in supply, QED.

This culminated in a report on the [state of the condo market by Urbanation](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/real-estate/toronto/toronto-condo-rental-market-soars-on-heels-of-new-measures/article35585753/), released in July: though supply went up, average rents have grown by an eye popping 11% and there are no vacancies in the system. The culprit, clearly, are the new rent control measures:

>“The message here is that we’re grossly under-building rentals and the rent control measures that were introduced are going to make it worse over time through less supply and less turnover,” said Shaun Hildebrand, senior vice-president of Urbanation.

This makes me sad, because I find these arguments range from the unconvincing to the disingenuous. I can't blame industry for acting in its self interest, but I do wish commentators employed a little more imagination and critical thinking. 

The reason is simple: the regulation of rent, like many other kinds of regulation, is a response to _market failure_. And, crucially, the experience of the past twenty years shows that rent controls are not the primary disincentive delaying supply from the market.

Our housing delivery system is complex. We regulate our housing markets in order to correct market inefficiencies, to prevent people from being exploited, and to change incentive structures to deliver outcomes we have deemed necessary or correct. We also significantly intervene, subsidize and shape the funding and price mechanism through which new housing is produced.

If the profit incentive alone were able to provide us with ample supply, moderate vacancy rates, and affordable and dignified living conditions, we wouldn't try to regulate and intervene to the extent that we do. 

It's not enough to look at any one piece of this in isolation. Let's examine the broader context.

<!--
When we regulate rents, our purpose is to preserve the security of tenure of our residents. In a well-functioning rental market, with ample supply and moderate vacancy rates, landlords lack the market power to gouge tenants and rent increases closely track inflation. However, our rental markets do not function properly; supply is contrained and vacancy rates are at all-time lows.

In this article, I will be examining the historical context we occupy, the reasons and ways in which we do regulate the housing market, and finally the state and economics 

In a well-functioning rental market, we probably wouldn't need rent controls. With ample supply and moderate vacancy rates, landlords would lack the market power to gouge and discriminate against tenants, and rent prices would closely track inflation. 

Instead, supply is constrained and vacancy rates are at all-time lows &mdash; and tenants face significant risks of undergoing an "economic eviction". Cities like Toronto are in the midst of a housing crisis, and, frankly, Ontario's residential rental market has been in one state of failure or another for well over thirty years.[^market-failure] In addition, as we will see later, the economics of purpose built rental buildings are negatively impacted by a wide variety of factors.

First, let us consider the context in which we operate.
-->


<h3>A Brief History of Housing in Canada</h3>

Property rights and the markets they enable exist to the extent they are enforced and protected by the state. When we establish and regulate rights, we typically seek to balance the interests and concerns of everyone involved, and revisit those tradeoffs as our values and goals shift over time. We think our food should be safe to eat, our doctors should be well trained, and that you shouldn't dump waste anywhere you feel like.

In Canada, it would be difficult to identify a time when we had a completely laissez faire housing market. Some of our earliest municipal bylaws regulated building standards. First, we sought to improve our health, safety, fire and construction standards, and later we gradually began to add a host of land use and development regulations.[^hulchanksi-laissez]

These regulations led to the elimination of unhealthy, unsafe and poor quality housing in urban areas. However, our improved housing standards (and restrictions on land use) led to an increase in the cost of its manufacture, and by 1914 it became apparent that the private market alone was not providing enough low income housing.[^hulchanksi-laissez] 

One intervention begat another. Federal incentives were introduced as early as 1938 to stimulate the development of low income rental housing, and by 1949 the government began to invest directly in its production.[^hulchanksi-laissez] Buoyed by the post-war economic and population boom,  we began to seriously expand our welfare state and, concerned with ensuring "enough rental housing production to nourish the golden goose of urban growth", from 1965 to 1995 up to 10% of all new housing was some mix of social housing.[^suttor-abriged]

These interventions were not limited to the poor; quite the opposite. In 1946, the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) was established with the aim of increasing home ownership among the broad middle and lower-middle class. Focussing mainly on making amortized mortgages work for house buyers and private investors in rental housing, by the mid-1960s most households obtained at least part of their mortgage loan directly from the federal government.[^hulchansky-bulletin38]

In fact, most of the history of the role of Canadian government housing policy is an effort to assist ownership. In 2005 alone, more individual homeowners were helped through mortgage insurance than the number of all social housing units funded since the 1970s. And in addition to creating cheaper loans, the federal government also provides subsidies through a variety of tax credits, tax sheltered investment vehicles and tax exemptions. As any property owner knows, the sale of your primary residence is exempt from capital gains &mdash; which by 2008 was costing us almost $6 billion a year in uncollected revenue.[^hulchansky-bulletin38]

In so far that our housing policy has targetted the middle class' standard of living, it has been rather successful. As an investment asset, home ownership confers unique benefits: it provides shelter as well as equity that can be withdrawn later in life. Canadians who pay off their mortgages spend on average only 11% of their income on housing and, by 1999, the average homeowner earned 208% more income, and owned 70 times more wealth, than the average tenant.[^hulchansky-bulletin38]

<!--Regulating land and its use &mdash; what to build and where and how &mdash; is one of the foundational tasks of the state. Some of the earliest municipal bylaws regulate building standards. Over time, we've sought to improve the health, safety, fire and construction standards of our housing and then 

Indeed, in Canada it's difficult to identify any period of laissez-faire housing market; some of the earliest municipal bylaws sought to regulate building standards.

Property rights, as granted and protected by our governments, are limited to the extent they interfere with the rights and legitimate interests of others. What we describe as a market in real estate did not emerge fully formed but is instead the result of many deliberate decisions made over time. -->

<h2>Making the moral case for rent stabilization</h2>

This is to say: what kind of living conditions do we want people to enjoy? and consequently, what, exactly, should be the goal of our housing system? have been considered important questions for over a century &mdash; and our answers to these questions have shifted over time. We began by regulating the safety of our housing, and today we significantly subsidize its ownership for those who can afford it. 

Similarly, our perception of the nature of the relationship between property owners and tenants has also shifted.

Under common law, which concerned itself with a leaseholder's (agricultural) relationship to the land, a landlord was under no statutory requirement to maintain the premises or conduct any repairs &mdash; nor were there any limits on their power to evict or even seize the property of tenants. A review of the applicable laws in 1968 found that landlords possessed such a disparity of bargaining power that tenants did not have a freedom of contract in any real sense.[^hulchanksi-tenant-rights]

For a variety of ethical, legal and economic reasons, it became clear that tenants deserved protection, and that applying old-school land law principles to the modern urban apartment rental was totally unsuitable. Gradually the law caught up: Ontario adopted its first residential protection laws in 1970, while the notion that tenants deserve security of tenure was added by 1975. Today, landlords are seen as responsible for providing safe and livable accomodations, and that tenants should be protected from arbitrary evictions.[^yee-1989]

Typically, this is framed as a conflict of self-interests between landlords and tenants; tenants suffer disproportionate costs when forced to move, and benefit from stability. But security of tenure doesn't just benefit individual tenants. The stability provided by security of tenure is the stuff from which well functioning communities are made of, and in that view, security of tenure is a public good.


<!--This is to say: what, exactly, should be the goal of our housing system? and, consequently, what kind of living conditions do we want people to enjoy? 

I think that we can all agree that, though obviously necessary to some extent, our property regime ought not be _solely_ organized around maximizing the profits of incumbent property owners. 

It seems clear to me that, given a choice, we should instead optimize our housing system as a whole to deliver and sustain healthy, well functioning communities that support our citizens as they age and transition through different lifecycles. Otherwise, what's the point?

Let's take this for granted. What's a well functioning community?-->

Our communities consist of both physical infrastructure, like roads and public transit, as well as "human" infrastructure, like community organizations and loose neighbourhood ties. A neighbourhood may be desirable for its proximity to a grocery store &mdash; but also for the quality of its schools, the absence of crime and the vitality of its community events. A healthy neighbourhood is one where its residents are looking out for one another.

In this tenants face substantial hurdles. I recently read Matthew Desmond's incredible and harrowing book "Eviction," in which he followed several low-income renters in the city of Milwaukee over the course of a year. Early on, he writes:

> "The public peace&mdash;the sidewalk and street peace&mdash;of cities is not kept primarily by the police, necessary as police are. It is kept primarily by an intricate, almost unconscious, network of voluntary controls and standards among the people themselves, and enforced by the people themselves." So wrote Jane Jacobs in _The Death and Life of Great American Cities_. Jacobs believed that a prerequisite for this type of healthy and engaged community was the presence of people who were simply present, who looked after the neighborhood.  She has been proved right: disadvantaged neighborhoods with higher levels of "collective efficacy"&mdash;the stuff of loosely linked neighbors who trust one another and share expectations about how to make their community better&mdash;have lower crime rates.

<!-- >A single eviction could destabilize multiple city blocks, not only the block from which a family was evicted but also the block to which it begrudgingly relocated. In this way, displacement contributed directly to what Jacobs called "perpetual slums," churning environments with high rates of turnover and even higher rates of resentment and divestment. -->



Towards the end of the book, he adds:

> Residential stability begets a kind of psychological stability, which allows people to invest in their home and social relationships. It begets school stability, which increases the chances that children will excel and graduate. And it begets community stability, which encourages neighbours to form strong bonds and take care of their block. But poor families enjoy little of that because they are evicted at such high rates. 

> [...]

> Eviction even affects the communities that displaced families leave behind. Neighbors who cooperate with and trust one another can make their streets safer and more prosperous. But that takes time. Efforts to establish local cohesion and community investment are thwarted in neighborhoods with high turnover rates. In this way, eviction can unravel the fabric of a community, helping to ensure that neighbors remain strangers and that their collective capacity to combat crime and promote civic engagement remains untapped.[^desmond]

Faced with the unpredictable but certain need to move in the near future, it's harder to establish deep ties to an neighbourhood. As a result, tenants are routinely discounted or ignored by our political structures, and face greater hardships accessing necessary social services and economic opportunities.

In addition, landlords are also strongly incentivized to cash in on new or improved local amenities provided either by the state or the local community itself. The reduction of crime, or the expansion of public transit, readily provide rationales for increasing rents. Creating conditions where tenants may reasonably fear the amelioration of their communities is a rather perverse outcome.[^lvt]

For these reasons, it's necessary to distinguish protecting the moral rights of existing, long term tenants from the problem of affordabiliy and supply.[^psmag] If the market is unable to sustain tenants' security of tenure, then we should find other ways to provide it.

Every regulation imposes tradeoffs, and in that light the regulation of rent should be seen as not unlike that of the regulation of fire safety. Mandating that landlords' properties satisfy certain minimum fire safety standards also raises costs and therefore diminishes the affordability of housing. Though some [are happy to make that macabre argument](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-06-16/beware-of-blaming-government-for-london-tower-fire), by and large we've decided it's a cost worth bearing: individual people are rarely in position to demand standards, and fires have large externalities. At some point, we will always be dealing with thresholds and equilibriums, and it is up to society to decide what is or isn't acceptable: only about 7 people per million will die this year in residential fires.


<!--
In that light, it's in the public interest that our citizens be provided with housing stability.  In principle, this could be delivered by a well supplied market.  If you can find a similarly priced apartment elsewhere, your landlord may be less inclined to raise your rent. But, in its absence, we must find other ways of guaranteeing these conditions.



Could a well supplied market alone deliver this outcome? If you can find a similarly priced apartment elsewhere, your landlord may be less inclined to raise your rent. However, this ignores the substantial regional variation in amenities and infrastructure over time.

Consider that, in the absence of measures like rent stabilization, landlords are strongly incentivized to cash in on new or improved local amenities provided by the state or the local community itself. Has a new LRT stop opened up nearby? Is the neighbourhood now a safer place to live? Time to increase rents! 

Consider further that there are substantial asymmetries in who can enjoy which infrastructure or amenities. For instance, the Parkdale neighourhood in Toronto hosts a significant Tibetan ethnic enclave, which in of itself may be insignificant to you or me &mdash; but if you're a recent Tibetan immigrant, residing near or within your ethnic enclave has a substantial impact on your job prospects, your social life and your ability to integrate with society at large.

In my opinion, leaving tenants in a position where they may reasonably fear the amelioration of their own communities is a perverse and wicked outcome.

(Those of you, in the back, shouting about land value taxation: yes, I agree but one thing at a time.)-->

  <h3>How it kind of used to work</h3>

  In the post-war era, back when land was abundant, interest rates were high and inflation rates did not flirt with the zero-bound, different levels of Canadian governments delivered stable and predictable housing costs through a mix of encouraging and subsidizing home ownership, subsidizing purpose built rental housing, and the large scale construction of rent geared to income social housing. In fact, from 1965 to 1995, up to 10% of all new housing in Canada was social housing. 

  This system is now broken. Our social housing programs were gutted in the '90s, leading to their present day deterioration. Meanwhile, post-Great Recesssion global economic conditions, in addition to unearned returns on equity for existing homeowners, have inflated housing prices beyond the reach of most young, middle and low income people. 
-->

In 2011, a little under half of the population of the city of Toronto rented their housing,[^census-2011] and in 2017 home-ownership is out of reach for the young and those with middle and low incomes.[^cbc-squeeze] Long term tenants have a legitimate interest in staying in the communities they themselves have made successful. Why should they be subjected to a tenure regime that significantly disadvantages them socially, economically and politically compared to the subsidized homeowning population?

We do ourselves a disservice when we ignore this dimension and frame it purely in terms of adversarial self interests. When we argue that rents should always be uncontrolled, even in tight markets experiencing rapid inflation, we're implicitly accepting that tenants do not deserve security of tenure. The discussion instead should be about how we can both deliver security of tenure and permit our housing provision system to function properly.

<h2>Making the economic case for rent stabilization</h2>

Let's address the main criticism: what about the lack of supply in our housing market?  While the social benefits are hard to value precisely, the cost of a tight housing market is all too readily apparent &mdash; and might outweigh the benefit.

When we talk about rental supply, we typically distinguish between the "primary" rental market, where professional landlords operate purpose built rental buildings, and the "secondary" rental market, where individuals rent out their basement apartments or spare condos.[^toronto-2006]

We typically favour primary rentals because only landlords that operate at scale can provide long-term accomodation and are more capable of absorbing maintenance costs. Condo units have a tendency to get flipped, and basement apartments are often vacated for the owner's own use.

The argument against controls goes something like this. Rent controls artificially depress the income that landlords can expect from rental properties and therefore hurt any motivation investors may have for responding to demand and creating new rental buildings. At the same time, lower rent costs relative to ownership encourage more people to stay in the rental market, therefore creating more demand. Seen in this light, a control imposed in response to market failure will therefore exacerbate it.

Furthermore, rent controls don't just affect new construction, and therefore new tenants; they can have stark effects on existing units as well. Faced with a control designed such that increases in rent grow at a rate slower than inflation, or the costs of maintaining the property, existing landlords are strongly encouraged to let their properties deteriorate, or convert them to condominiums. 

We're blessed that Ontario and Toronto are relatively well studied jurisdictions. A widely cited 1988 study of Ontario's rental market argued that all of the above occurred in Ontario after the province instituted its 1975 rent controls. The author found that real rents and capital values of rental units collapsed, and that Toronto lost 11% of its moderately priced rental housing stock through conversions, demolition and eviction through renovation. By 1986, vacancy rates were an extremely low 0.1%, but the market was unable to add supply; to quote,

> In a normally functioning, uncontrolled housing market a vacancy rate below the natural (or equilibrium) rate triggers an increase in real rents and real capital values. This in turn stimulates increased expenditures on the existing stock and increased new construction. Rent controls break this connection between low vacancies and large housing expenditures, and thereby impede the market adjustment necessary to satisfy the excess demand. [^smith-1988]

This line of reasoning is intuitively appealing, and is the commonly recited received textbook wisdom. Obviously, limiting income and returns below expenses will have negative impacts.


<!--

However, a sleight of hand is performed here. Some of these assumptions encode ideological normative claims, and not all controls are designed equal. Most importantly, affordability and new construction are impacted by a complex set of independent factors.

Rent control is great for the people who already live here, but it won't preserve affordability for newcomers. People don't stay put forever, and there will come a time when they will want to move for perfectly voluntary reasons &mdash; upon which they'll be subject to market rents once again. Rent control, then, encourages people to stay put and exacerbates the problem of affordability in the first place.

This view in of itself is unobjectionable. In isolation, and all other things remaining the same, if I'm looking to make an investment I'm obviously going to be motivated by my returns &mdash; and policies that affect those profit margins are going to make investments like rental housing less attractive. Indeed, a study in 1988 -->


<!--
Of course, this ignores the social benefits of such a policy. After all, every regulation imposes tradeoffs, and you can construct similar arguments around any other regulation that seeks to protect tenants. 

For example, mandating that landlords keep certain minimum fire safety standards also raises costs, and lowers margins, with similar attendant effects. Though some will [happily make that macabre argument](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-06-16/beware-of-blaming-government-for-london-tower-fire), by and large we've decided it's a cost worth bearing. At some point, we will always be dealing with thresholds and equilibriums, and it is up to society to decide what is or isn't acceptable.

As a result, it's necessary to distinguish the preservation of affordability, as a policy, from the creation of new supply. However, let's engage with this argument. What _has_ happened to our rental supply? -->

<h3>The case of the vanishing rental supply</h3>

Our rental housing sector has been in a state of crisis for over forty years.[^smith-1983] 
Beginning in the 1970s, the construction of new private rental buildings collapsed. If throughout Ontario in 1969 there were 27,543 new, unassisted rental building starts, by 1986 we were only building 4,849.[^smith-1988] Private developers began to leave the market and, though their departure was initially compensated by government assisted housing starts, before long the provincial and federal governments began to withdraw funding as well.[^toronto-2006]

<figure>
<a href="/img/Ontario Housing Starts 1969-1986 Bar Chart.png"><img src="/img/Ontario Housing Starts 1969-1986 Bar Chart.png"></a>
</figure>


Rent controls were introduced in the province in 1975 and then modified several times throughout the years. [IMPROVE WITH DESC FROM THAT BRIT PAPER] At first, rents were essentially fixed in nominal terms, which in a high inflation era meant their real values quickly declined. New construction was at first exempted, and then not; by 1986 the guidelines were changed such that rent adjustments were now tied to inflation.[^smith-1988]


From the same 1988 study mentioned above, 

> The timing and severity of the decline in rental housing starts, especially in government unassisted rental starts, and the contrast with the pattern of single detached, semi-detached and duplex starts suggest rent controls substantially reduced the volume of new rental contruction in Ontario. 

> [Other factors such as less favourable demographics, rising interest rates, and increased tenant protection may have exacerbated the decline in rental starts, but rent controls appear to be the primary factor.] [^smith-1988]


Let's take this for granted, then. Rent controls appear to be the primary factor. This paper was published some time ago. What has happened since?

In a bid to stimulate new purpose built rental construction, in 1992 rent controls for new buildings were once again exempted. In 1998, the Harris government initiated the most dramatic change since their introduction: capital expenditures could now be fully recovered, vacancy decontrol was introduced for existing units, and rents in new buildings were permanently deregulated.[^rent-control-city-report] [^smith-2003] [^rta-2006]

This means that for over twenty years we've lived in a regime where new construction lacked any kind of rent control.  If rent controls substantially reduce the volume of new rental construction, what should have happened since then?

Compiling data provided by the CMHC and a report by the City of Toronto's Planning Policy & Research department,[^toronto-2006] I produced the following graph of metro Toronto housing completions:[^notes-on-completions]

<figure>
<a href="/img/Toronto Housing Completions 1981-2016 - bar chart2.png"><img src="/img/Toronto Housing Completions 1981-2016 - bar chart2.png"></a>
</figure>

The difference stands out more when we change the graph type:

<figure>
<a href="/img/Toronto Housing Completions 1981-2016 - 100pc stacked bar chart2.png"><img src="/img/Toronto Housing Completions 1981-2016 - 100pc stacked bar chart2.png"></a>
</figure>

From 1981 to 1997, we averaged 2,836 new primary rental units, or 39% of total production. By 1998, we virtually ceased production and from 2000-2016 we averaged 880 new rental units per year, which made up a mere 6% of total supply.[^methodological-notes]

If rent controls were the _primary factor_ inhibiting new construction, then surely we'd expect to see the opposite. If rent controls are such a substantial disincentive, then surely we'd be building them in the same quantites, if not percentage of the market, than we did during Ontario's rent control's most destructive period. 

Opponents of controls argue that developers continued to price in the risk of their reintroduction,[^brescia-2005] but judged over the course of almost a generation that argument is wanting. 

What else is happening?

<h3>The gap between new and existing rents</h3>

It's important to understand how rental buildings get built. The economics behind residential housing construction are dominated by the cost of equity, the cost of debt, the price of land, regulatory compliance and taxation.[^black-2012] [^hswg-2001] [^investopedia] Next to these, labour and materials are relatively fixed costs.[^brescia-2005-2]

A developer or builder leading the construction of a new building must obtain financing, obtain land, get the municipality to approve the project, actually build the building, sell or rent it, and then pay taxes &mdash; though not necessarily in that order. And, of course, all this effort must have a better or comparable rate of return than other projects at their disposal.[^black-2012]

Though in the past many rental building owners also participated in their construction, today developers and owners tend to be separate actors with distinct business models. As a result, while operating a rental building can be desirable, building a new one often isn't.[^hswg-2001] 

Building to rent is riskier than building to sell. With condominium projects, construction doesn't begin until a majority of units are pre-sold, which lowers financing costs and the amount of necessary equity. By the time the condo units are occupied, the developer has realized their returns and freed up their equity for use in other projects.[^black-2012] Land values, which account for 15-30% of the cost, are thus driven by the more profitable condominium projects.[^pomeroy-2001]

Since a rental building doesn't generate income until it's completed, it's harder to assess and demonstrate its financial feasability. This means more equity is needed to obtain more expensive financing &mdash; equity which won't be recouped for years or decades to come.[^black-2012] Given that the rent necessary to recoup an investment is largely determined by debt servicing and other operating costs, this means that new projects must typically target the top end of the market. 

<!--Even in the most favourable business climate, it will generablly be more profitable to target the high end. In the absence of subsidies, the private sector is unlikely to build new rental housing for the low end of the market.[^hswg-2001]-->

This leads us to the main problem: new supply can't target existing demand. Simply put, average market rents are often lower than the rent necessary to sustain new construction. This can happen even in the absence of rent controls, since existing housing stock, burdened with less debt, is profitable at lower rent prices. Meanwhile, the people most inclined to pay high end rents are siphoned off from rentals onto the ownership market. Given the many ways in which we subsidize and reward ownership, if you can carry the mortgage it usually makes financial sense to do so.


All of this conspires to make profit margins in the multi-residential investment market very narrow.[^hswg-2001] Small shifts in financing terms, land values, taxation and the costs incurred due to delays in the regulatory planning process can have huge impacts in the feasibility of a given project.

<h3>Building a new narrative</h3>

This brings us back to our earlier question: what else has happened?

We can look over the history of rental starts and conclude that Ontario's rent controls, and the debate that led to their implementation in 1975, had a dramatic effect. We could further point to 1992's Rent Control Act, which prevented landlords from recovering capital investments, and conclude that was the final nail in the coffin. As discussed above, the profitability of a rental building can be sensitive to minor changes in net income. But rent controls weren't the only thing going on.

</figure>

Seeking to make our tax system more equitable, close "loopholes" and reorient which industries it incentivized,[^budget-1971] starting in 1972 and throughout the subsequent decades, the federal government implemented a series of changes to our income tax laws. 

It began to tax capital gains, changed the rate at which capital costs can be depreciated, which class of investor can claim capital cost deductions and removed the deduction of "soft costs".[^hswg-2001] Additionally, in 1991 the Goods and Services Tax was introduced, which increased the sales tax burden on new construction by almost 70 per cent.[^enemark-2017]

Unfortunately, these changes were made with little, if any, consideration of their adverse consequences on our housing policy goals.[^clayton-1998] The practical effect of these changes were substantial, and made investment in rental housing less attractive for small investors[^miron-1995] since the manner in which an asset is depreciated can have a relatively large impact on after tax returns.[^hswg-2001]

We could say that Ontario's rent controls, and the debate that led to their implementation in 1975, had a dramatic chilling effect, and that furthermore Ontario's 1992 Rent Control Act, which prevented landlords from recovering capital investments, sealed the deal entirely.

However, we should also the consider the role the federal government had when it initiated a substantial reform of the country's income tax system in 1971 and its subsequent changes throughought the 70s and 80s &mdash; as well as the introduction in 1991 of the goods and services tax.[^clayton-1998]



Simply put, constructing new rental buildings is by and large not a profitable venture &mdash; but for reasons unconnected

Simply put, it seems that though owning a rental building is a profitable enterprise, constructing new rental buildings is by and large unprofitable.[^black-2012] [^hulchanski-1997]

for almost as long as we have had apartments they've tended to be developed for upper and occasionally mid market; furthermore, higher income earners are substantially encouraged to buy.

the economics and business model of developers and operators have to be seen separately

developers want faster returns on equity and financing costs are lower due to presales

the valuation of an apartment building can be modeled by the income divided by discounted blah blah, and is therefore dominated by the equity financing required

so long as the recovery rent is more expensive than what the market will bear what's the point of investing? 

condos have higher returns 

cost of building therefore dominated by land price, regulatory costs and financing costs; once they are built, that initial cost is what determines the rent recovery

the reason why rentals are on the upswing stems from a gradual shift in the industry towards lower cap rates, AND rents have finally been approaching recovery rates which is like, moot

the process of filtering may or may not actually be real but rents are already unaffordable and assuming land continues to highly priced will also be unaffordable, clearly what we need is to lower the threshold of capital necessary

no where is this process more evident than comparing seattle to vancouver

seattle builds all these rental buildings, and vancouver does not - and according to these two studies (smith, plus the other guy/tyee link) it's because of income taxes changes that occurred in 1972.

[what about zoning?]

compare graph of smith's housing start data, connection of vacancy rate to natural demographic lifecycles plus middle income earners unable to buy / bidding it up

ultimately, balance between equity, rights and efficient allocation of resources. core housing need is another way of saying people don't make enough money, but actually main benefitters of unregulated controls have been secondary market owners which now comprise 30% of toronto rental universe. considering the equity requirements, the main profit in condos is their sale down the road so on the one hand i'd argue they do not contribute to market elasticity - esp if we're just building condos, plus it's again perverse to have our housing provision mechanism select for the preferences of investors than the people who might want to live there - and more importantly are just a weird transfer from lower income to higher income people.


we need to change our relationship to urban land and discourage unproductive use. fraser quote on how most gdp comes from cities

argument for funding rentals based on enabling mobility - if wanted - and improving productivity.




<!--It's important to recognize that the Canadian housing market does not work in isolation. As discussed above, the government intervenes and subsidizes it at many different levels. 

If we want to talk about just private purpose built rentals, the above graph actually understates the problem: a majority of the rentals built from 1981-1997 are in fact social housing. The spike we see in 1993-1996 is actually the dying gasp of our federal and provincial social housing programs - killed in 1993 and 1995 respectively.[^suttor-abriged]

[^notes-on-completions]: The careful reader has noticed that I am mixing Ontario starts with Toronto completions. They measure slightly different things: not all housing starts get completed, and completions can lag starts by several years. I'm not trying to pull a fast one; I'm simply limited by the dataset I was able to find. CMHC's website does not report data prior to 1990, but combining it with the City of Toronto's 2006 Rental Housing Supply and Demand Indicators report I was able to extend it back to 1981. It is my opinion that, for the purposes of discussing the effects of economic disincentives on new construction, these data sets are both valid.

[^methodological-notes]: Some methodological notes: here "rental + co-op" include both private and "assisted" (i.e. government subsidies or funded) units; City of Toronto data ends in 2005, and I was unable to find CMHC data that separated the assisted from private from 2006-2016. The picture then is even more bleak: a large majority of the units produced from 1981-2006 were subsidized. Private rentals had slowly petered out by 1992, and then in 1997 assisted units completely dried up for a few years. By 2005, private rentals had begun to recover but even then 623 private units were completed &mdash; against 354 assisted units. Media reports since then indicate that private rentals are on the upswing, but in 2016 there were 1,094 total new rental units compared to 1986's 1,208 private rentals.

There are many issues at play here. To begin, measures like rent stabilization do not exist in a vaccum. It is simply incorrect to 

 
They're unimaginative because though the costs are concentrated and easy to measure, the benefits stand to be much larger, if diffusely distributed. They're Disingenuous, because 


because in their zeal to protect margins industry participants will happily muddy the waters; after all, Urbanation's [report from _January_](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/real-estate/toronto/torontos-hot-housing-market-spills-over-to-condo-rentals/article33627170/) had identical conclusions: rents are up by 11% and there are no vacancies in the system.



I believe rent stabilization is a public good, and rent stabilization is _necessary_. It's time more people within urbanist circles defended these measures.

To begin, ask yourself this: what exactly is the point of our housing system? and, what kind of living conditions do we want people to have?

Consider that predictable and stable housing costs are a prerequisite for well-functioning communities. In the absence of stability, tenants cannot invest in their neighbourhoods and fully participate as civic actors. Well-functioning communities provide services for their 

Rent evictions tear away at the fabric of local communities and, in so far that they're enforced by the state, directly waste our tax dollars for private gain.

Rent evictions hit low-income workers the hardest, and invariably displaces them towards lower-amenity and less desireable locations. 

Applied to the entire region at once, and in so far that they reduce total rent-extraction, I would even argue that in the long run measures like rent stabilization are probably _more_ economically efficient. Housing, in the economic sense, is a terribly unproductive thing to be diverting our resources towards. Why we should reward property owners with higher returns due to investments made by the state (via public services) or by local residents (via community groups)?

(Yes, land value taxes are probably best. Insert an argument for them here.)

To create and sustain a housing market where neighbourhoods can be disrupted and long-time tenants can be kicked out on a whim has very obvious and measurable consequences on people's health, income earning potential and the functioning of our civic society. It is unjust, not to mention also penny-wise-and-pound-foolish.

It is fine and appropriate to note that tenants are harmed by the absence of rental supply. In a vaccum, rent stabilization clearly acts as a disincentive, given how it lowers profit margins. How can we address this? Land and its use is one of the most well-regulated aspects of our society. It's insufficient


Rent evictions tear away at the fabric of neighbourhoods and in so far that they're enforced by the state, cost the government money.

The dual-class system we used to inhabit &mdash; whereby only homeowners got to enjoy predictable and stable housing costs &mdash; was outrageously unfair. 

Furthermore, in the long run rent stabilization is more economically efficient: 


The Toronto housing crisis is a complicated and deep topic. Like many other complex systems, the failure of our housing system is overdeterminedand, when discussing Toronto's lack of cheap and affordable housing, there exists a rich variety of causal narratives to pick from.

However, useful _goals_ of our housing system are easy to discuss. When we talk about the housing crisis, we are concerned with two things: whether our city can grow (economically, productively, population wise, etc), and whether our communities can thrive. Furthermore, you can't have one without the other. This is almost a trite tautology, but it's worth restating: without growth, our communities will stagnate and whither away and, without functioning communities providing pleasant places to live, we heavily restrict or destroy entirely the growth we're able to experience.

Let's restate that yet again. Cities are the economic engines of our service-based economy. Cities have captured most of the growth and the productivity gains in recent decades because higher population densities allow for economies of scale and yield higher returns on quote unquote "innovation". At the same time, high skill, high value-add industries require a whole ecosystem of medium and low skill industries. Someone has to clean our offices, cook our food and look after our kids. Someone has to teach those kids, build buildings and look after the elderly.

To prevent newcomers from living in our city is to spite prosperity; to turn around and push out everyone who makes a city _work_ is to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs.


Recently, Urbanation released a [report on conditions in the Toronto condo rental market](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/real-estate/toronto/torontos-hot-housing-market-spills-over-to-condo-rentals/article33627170/), and the picture ain't good: though supply is up, rental prices have grown by an eye popping 11% and there are no vacancies in the system. They blame this on rent control measures re-introduced by the government of Ontario in April of this year.

This is disingenuous of them, and I wish they would reconsider. Their methodology is suspect; the recency of these measures renders their conclusion void; but most damningly I think is simply that the numbers are identical from their _january_ report. A mere six months ago rents were up 11%, and there were no vacancies in the system. To be pedantic, it's barely even news if in fact, according to Urbanation, rents have gone up 11% per year on average for the past twelve years.





The Toronto housing crisis is a rich, complex topic but it can ultimately be boiled down to two concerns: we must ensure the city can continue to grow, and we must ensure that our communities can thrive.

It may not seem obvious, but in the absence of growth our communities will not whither; and the absence of thriving communities will prevent our city can continue to grow.

Recently, Urbanation released a [report on conditions in the Toronto condo rental market](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/real-estate/toronto/torontos-hot-housing-market-spills-over-to-condo-rentals/article33627170/), and the picture ain't good: though supply is up, rental prices have grown by an eye popping 11% and there are no vacancies in the system. They blame this on rent control measures re-introduced by the government of Ontario in April of this year.

This was annoying to me, because a careful examination reveals it to be specious. We could talk about its methodological flaws, or how these measures simply haven't been around long enough to study their impact. For our purposes, suffice it to say that [Urbanation's _January_ report](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/real-estate/toronto/torontos-hot-housing-market-spills-over-to-condo-rentals/article33627170/) had identical conclusions: rents are up by 11%, there are no vacancies in the system. In fact, rents have been [going up by 11% on average](https://www.urbanation.ca/news/181-rental-demand-reaches-record-high-following-new-housing-rules) _since 2005_.

In short, this is a crappy outcome but it isn't really about rent control. The Toronto rental and real estate markets, due to a combination of outdated land use regulations and historically low interest rates, have been irrationally exuberant for a little over a decade and lately have become poised to radically alter the social fabric of the city.

Everyone's a [rent control](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/rent-control-isnt-the-solution-to-ontarios-housing-problem/article34753102/) [skeptic](http://tvo.org/article/current-affairs/the-next-ontario/ontario-needs-a-rental-rethink-but-should-tread-carefully) and the case against it is easy to make: [econ 101 predicts it will restrict the supply](https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2015/08/economist-explains-19) of purpose-built rental buildings. But that's only half the picture, and for all our sake we should strive to move beyond econ 101. Rent control is good, and it is necessary.

It's in this context that I would like to defend rent control, and specifically, rent stabilization: the notion that, once you've taken up residency, your housing costs should roughly track inflation.

My argument is simple: if we don't provide people with a baseline security of tenancy, we can't make cities the livable, pleasant and super-productive places we want them to be. Absent 

Stable housing costs are important because without them we cannot ensure security of tenancy.
