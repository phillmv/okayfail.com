title: Actually, Rent Control Is Great
# draft: true
---

In April, the government of Ontario decided to extend rent control to every dwelling in the province, as opposed to just buildings constructed before 1991.

Different jurisdictions have overlapping definitions of "rent control". What Ontario engages in is described by some academics and regions as a tenancy rent control, or rent stabilization. It works like this: everyone's rent is subject to a price control. Throughout the duration of your tenancy, your landlord can only raise your monthly rent according to a threshold pegged to inflation, and to recover capital expenditures. Between tenants, landlords are free to price rents at whatever the market will bear.

This prompted a lot of commentary, ranging from [benign skepticism](http://tvo.org/article/current-affairs/the-next-ontario/ontario-needs-a-rental-rethink-but-should-tread-carefully) to [vigorous condemnation](https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/real-estate/toronto/new-ontario-rent-control-rules-exact-opposite-of-what-is-needed-analyst-warns/article34569276/). The chorus sounds like this:

Against all common sense, the province is handing its cities a poisoned chalice: it is textbook economics that price controls sharply reduce the value of new construction.[^tgam-gee]  Under rent control, the quantity and quality of available rental units will fall as developers are less incentivized to build or invest in rental properties &mdash; all of which exacerbates any price crunch.[^tal-cibc] The fact is, rent control would largely help high-end renters in a high-end market, since most units built after the rent control exemption are condos. It’s tough to see how it would accomplish much except transferring money from unit owners to their tenants.[^selley] Instead, the province should be tackling the root of the problem &mdash; the supply of new housing units in Toronto et al is not keeping up with demand.[^thesun]

I find these takes range from the unconvincing to the disingenuous. Our housing delivery system is complex. The regulation of rent, like many other kinds of regulation, is a response to _market failure_. We regulate our housing markets in order to correct market inefficiencies, to prevent people from being exploited, and to change incentive structures to deliver outcomes we have deemed necessary or correct. We also significantly intervene, subsidize and shape the funding and price mechanisms through which new housing is produced.

Very few if any skeptics writing on this topic engage with the social problem that a rent control seeks to solve: guaranteeing that people who rent get to enjoy long-term stability in their housing, commonly known as security of tenure. At the same time, they obscure the fact that not all rent controls are designed equal. While early rent controls were harmful, a careful examination reveals that rent regulation like Ontario's can be safely implemented &mdash; and that there are far more serious disincentives and barriers preventing new supply.



 It's important to understand the full context in which we operate.

 <h3>A Brief History of Housing in Canada</h3>

Property rights and the markets they enable exist to the extent they are enforced and protected by the state. When we establish and regulate rights, we typically seek to balance the interests and concerns of everyone involved, and revisit those tradeoffs as our values and goals shift over time. We think our food should be safe to eat, our doctors should be well trained, and that you shouldn't dump waste anywhere you feel like.

In Canada, it would be difficult to identify a time when we had a completely laissez faire housing market. Some of our earliest municipal bylaws regulated building standards. First, we sought to improve our health, safety, fire and construction standards, and later we gradually began to add a host of land use and development regulations.[^hulchanksi-laissez]

These regulations led to the elimination of unhealthy, unsafe and poor quality housing in urban areas. However, our improved housing standards (and restrictions on land use) led to an increase in the cost of its manufacture, and by 1914 it became apparent that the private market alone was not providing enough low income housing.[^hulchanksi-laissez] 

One intervention begat another. Federal incentives were introduced as early as 1938 to stimulate the development of low income rental housing, and by 1949 the government began to invest directly in its production.[^hulchanksi-laissez] Buoyed by the post-war economic and population boom,  we began to seriously expand our welfare state and, concerned with ensuring "enough rental housing production to nourish the golden goose of urban growth", from 1965 to 1995 up to 10% of all new housing was some mix of social housing.[^suttor-abriged]

These interventions were not limited to the poor; quite the opposite. In 1946, the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) was established with the aim of increasing home ownership among the broad middle and lower-middle class. Focussing mainly on making amortized mortgages work for house buyers and private investors in rental housing, by the mid-1960s most households obtained at least part of their mortgage loan directly from the federal government.[^hulchanski-bulletin38]

In fact, most of the history of the role of Canadian government housing policy is an effort to assist ownership. In 2005 alone, more individual homeowners were helped through mortgage insurance than the number of all social housing units funded since the 1970s. And in addition to creating cheaper loans, the federal government also provides subsidies through a variety of tax credits, tax sheltered investment vehicles and tax exemptions. As any property owner knows, the sale of your primary residence is exempt from capital gains &mdash; which by 2008 was costing us almost $6 billion a year in uncollected revenue.[^hulchanski-bulletin38]

In so far that our housing policy has targetted the middle class' standard of living, it has been rather successful. As an investment asset, home ownership confers unique benefits: it provides shelter as well as equity that can be withdrawn later in life. Canadians who pay off their mortgages spend on average only 11% of their income on housing and, by 1999, the average homeowner earned 208% more income, and owned 70 times more wealth, than the average tenant.[^hulchanski-bulletin38]

<h2>Making the moral case for rent stabilization</h2>

This is to say: what kind of living conditions do we want people to enjoy? and consequently, what, exactly, should be the goal of our housing system? have been considered important questions for over a century &mdash; and our answers to these questions have shifted over time. We began by regulating the safety of our housing, and today we significantly subsidize its ownership for those who can afford it. 

Similarly, our perception of the nature of the relationship between property owners and tenants has also shifted.

Under common law, which concerned itself with a leaseholder's (agricultural) relationship to the land, a landlord was under no statutory requirement to maintain the premises or conduct any repairs &mdash; nor were there any limits on their power to evict or even seize the property of tenants. A review of the applicable laws in 1968 found that landlords possessed such a disparity of bargaining power that tenants did not have a freedom of contract in any real sense.[^hulchanksi-tenant-rights]

For a variety of ethical, legal and economic reasons, it became clear that tenants deserved protection, and that applying old-school land law principles to the modern urban apartment rental was totally unsuitable. Gradually the law caught up: Ontario adopted its first residential protection laws in 1970, while the notion that tenants deserve security of tenure was added by 1975. Today, landlords are seen as responsible for providing safe and livable accomodations, and that tenants should be protected from arbitrary evictions.[^yee-1989]

Often, this is framed as a conflict of self-interests between landlords and tenants; tenants suffer disproportionate costs when forced to move, and benefit from stability. But security of tenure doesn't just benefit individual tenants. The stability provided by security of tenure is the stuff from which well functioning communities are made of, and in that view, security of tenure is a public good.

Our communities consist of both physical infrastructure, like roads and public transit, as well as "human" infrastructure, like community organizations and loose neighbourhood ties. A neighbourhood may be desirable for its proximity to a grocery store &mdash; but also for the quality of its schools, the absence of crime and the vitality of its community events. A healthy neighbourhood is one where its residents are looking out for one another.

In this tenants face substantial hurdles. I recently read Matthew Desmond's incredible and harrowing book "Eviction," in which he followed several low-income renters in the city of Milwaukee over the course of a year. Early on, he writes:

> "The public peace&mdash;the sidewalk and street peace&mdash;of cities is not kept primarily by the police, necessary as police are. It is kept primarily by an intricate, almost unconscious, network of voluntary controls and standards among the people themselves, and enforced by the people themselves." So wrote Jane Jacobs in _The Death and Life of Great American Cities_. Jacobs believed that a prerequisite for this type of healthy and engaged community was the presence of people who were simply present, who looked after the neighborhood.  She has been proved right: disadvantaged neighborhoods with higher levels of "collective efficacy"&mdash;the stuff of loosely linked neighbors who trust one another and share expectations about how to make their community better&mdash;have lower crime rates.

Towards the end of the book, he adds:

> Residential stability begets a kind of psychological stability, which allows people to invest in their home and social relationships. It begets school stability, which increases the chances that children will excel and graduate. And it begets community stability, which encourages neighbours to form strong bonds and take care of their block. But poor families enjoy little of that because they are evicted at such high rates. 

> [...]

> Eviction even affects the communities that displaced families leave behind. Neighbors who cooperate with and trust one another can make their streets safer and more prosperous. But that takes time. Efforts to establish local cohesion and community investment are thwarted in neighborhoods with high turnover rates. In this way, eviction can unravel the fabric of a community, helping to ensure that neighbors remain strangers and that their collective capacity to combat crime and promote civic engagement remains untapped.[^desmond]

Faced with the unpredictable but certain need to move in the near future, it's harder to establish deep ties to an neighbourhood. As a result, tenants are routinely discounted or ignored by our political structures,[^mcgrath-2017] and face greater hardships accessing necessary social services and economic opportunities.

In addition, landlords are also strongly incentivized to cash in on new or improved local amenities provided either by the state or the local community itself. The reduction of crime, or the expansion of public transit, readily provide rationales for increasing rents. Creating conditions where tenants may reasonably fear the amelioration of their communities is a rather perverse outcome.

For these reasons, it's necessary to distinguish protecting the moral rights of existing, long term tenants from the problem of affordabiliy and supply.[^psmag] If the market is unable to sustain tenants' security of tenure, then we should find other ways to provide it.

Every regulation imposes tradeoffs, and in that light the regulation of rent should be seen as not unlike that of the regulation of fire safety. Mandating that landlords' properties satisfy certain minimum fire safety standards also raises costs and therefore diminishes the affordability of housing. Though some are happy to make that macabre argument,[^mcardle-2017] by and large we've decided it's a cost worth bearing: individual people are rarely in position to demand improved construction standards, and fires have large externalities. At some point, we will always be dealing with thresholds and equilibriums, and it is up to society to decide what is or isn't acceptable: in Ontario, only about 7 people per million die every year in residential fires.[^fire-deaths]


<!--

In 2011, a little under half of the population of the city of Toronto rented their housing,[^census-2011] and in 2017 home-ownership is out of reach for the young and those with middle and low incomes.[^cbc-squeeze] Long term tenants have a legitimate interest in staying in the communities they themselves have made successful. Why should they be subjected to a tenure regime that significantly disadvantages them socially, economically and politically compared to the subsidized homeowning population?

We do ourselves a disservice when we ignore this dimension and frame it purely in terms of adversarial self interests. When we argue that rents should always be uncontrolled, even in tight markets experiencing rapid inflation, we're implicitly accepting that tenants do not deserve security of tenure. The discussion instead should be about how we can both deliver security of tenure and ensure our housing provision system functions properly.

<h2>Revisiting Ontario's experience</h2>

Let's address the main criticism: what about the lack of supply in our housing market?  While the social benefits are hard to value precisely, the cost of a tight housing market is all too readily apparent &mdash; and might outweigh the benefit.

When we talk about rental supply, we typically distinguish between the "primary" rental market, where professional landlords operate purpose built rental buildings, and the "secondary" rental market, where individuals rent out their basement apartments or spare condos.[^toronto-2006]

We typically favour primary rentals because professional, full-time landlords are more capable of absorbing maintenance costs, and are far likelier to provide long-term accomodation. Condo units have a tendency to get flipped, and basement apartments are often vacated for the owner's own use.

The argument against controls goes something like this. Rent controls artificially depress the income that landlords can expect from rental properties and therefore hurt any motivation investors may have for responding to demand by creating new rental buildings. At the same time, lower rent costs relative to ownership encourage more people to stay in the rental market, therefore creating more demand. A control imposed in response to market failure will therefore exacerbate it.

Furthermore, rent controls don't just affect new construction, and therefore new tenants; they can have stark effects on existing units as well. Faced with a control designed such that increases in rent grow at a rate slower than inflation, or the costs of maintaining the property, existing landlords are strongly encouraged to let their properties deteriorate, or convert them to condominiums. 

We're blessed that Ontario and Toronto are relatively well studied jurisdictions. A widely cited 1988 study of Ontario's rental market argued that all of the above occurred in Ontario after the province instituted its 1975 rent controls. The author found that real rents and capital values of rental units collapsed, and that Toronto lost 11% of its moderately priced rental housing stock through conversions, demolition and eviction through renovation. By 1986, vacancy rates were an extremely low 0.1%, but the market was unable to add supply; to quote,

> In a normally functioning, uncontrolled housing market a vacancy rate below the natural (or equilibrium) rate triggers an increase in real rents and real capital values. This in turn stimulates increased expenditures on the existing stock and increased new construction. Rent controls break this connection between low vacancies and large housing expenditures, and thereby impede the market adjustment necessary to satisfy the excess demand. [^smith-1988]


<h3>The case of the vanishing rental supply</h3>

Our rental housing sector has been in a state of crisis for about forty years.[^smith-1983] 
Beginning in the 1970s, the construction of new private rental buildings collapsed. If throughout Ontario in 1969 there were 27,543 new, unassisted rental building starts, by 1986 we were only building 4,849.[^smith-1988] Private developers began to leave the market and, though their departure was initially compensated by government assisted housing starts, before long the provincial and federal governments began to withdraw funding as well.[^toronto-2006]

<figcaption>
<b>Figure 1.</b> Ontario housing starts by intended market 1969-1986. Note that this graph does not distinguish between private and government assisted rentals; from 1969-1974, private rentals constituted 72% of all starts, but from 1975 onwards assisted starts were over half of all rentals.</sup>
</figcaption>
</figure>


Rent controls were introduced in the province in 1975 and then modified several times throughout the years. At first, rents were essentially fixed in nominal terms, which in a high inflation era meant their real values quickly declined. New construction was at first exempted, and then not; by 1986 the guidelines were changed such that rent adjustments were now tied to inflation.[^smith-1988]

From the same 1988 study mentioned above, 

> The timing and severity of the decline in rental housing starts, especially in government unassisted rental starts, and the contrast with the pattern of single detached, semi-detached and duplex starts suggest rent controls substantially reduced the volume of new rental contruction in Ontario. 

> [Other factors such as less favourable demographics, rising interest rates, and increased tenant protection may have exacerbated the decline in rental starts, but rent controls appear to be the primary factor.] [^smith-1988]


Let's take this for granted, then. Rent controls appear to be the primary factor. This paper was published some time ago. What has happened since?

 In 1992, the Rent Control Act limited the kind of capital expenditures landlords could recover via rent increases and once again exempted new rental housing from rent control for a period of 5 years.[^miron-1995] In 1998, the Harris government initiated the most dramatic change since their introduction: capital expenditures could now be fully recovered, vacancy decontrol was introduced for existing units, and rents in new buildings were permanently deregulated.[^rent-control-city-report] [^smith-2003] [^rta-2006]

This means that for over twenty years we've lived in a regime where new construction lacked any kind of rent control. If rent controls by themselves are the main disincentive acting on the volume of new rental construction, what should have happened since then?

Compiling data provided by the CMHC, I was able to extend <a href="#fref:fig1">Figure 1</a> up to the present day:

<figure id="fref:fig2">
<a href="/img/Ontario Housing Starts 1969-2016 Bar Chart.png"><img src="/img/Ontario Housing Starts 1969-2016 Bar Chart.png"></a>
<figcaption>
<b>Figure 2.</b> Ontario housing starts by intended market 1969-2016. Note that data from 1987 onwards is restricted to areas with over 10,000 people, and therefore undercounts total starts.</sup>
</figcaption>
</figure>

During the 1969-1974 pre-rent control period for which we have data, there were on average 32,704 unassisted rental starts per year, or about 30% of total production. From 2009 to 2016, a period without any rent controls, Ontario averaged 5,147 new rental unit starts or a mere 10% of total supply. 

If rent controls were the primary factor inhibiting new construction today, then surely we'd expect to see the opposite. Why aren't we building them in similar percentages, if not quantities, than we did during Ontario's rent control's most destructive period?

Opponents of controls argue that developers continued to price in the risk of their reintroduction,[^brescia-2005] but judged over the course of almost a generation that argument is wanting.

What else is happening?

<h3>The rise of the condominium</h3>

Reviewing the literature on the topic, I was able to identify two other significant events. The first happened in 1967, when Ontario legalized condominiums &mdash; creating a new form of property ownership and thereby substantially altering the economics behind multi-residential buildings.

<figure id="fref:fig3">
<a href="/img/Ontario Housing Starts 1969-2016 Bar Chart With Condos.png"><img src="/img/Ontario Housing Starts 1969-2016 Bar Chart With Condos.png"></a>
<figcaption>
<b>Figure 3.</b> Figure 2, but distinguishing condos from single, detached and other housing.
</figcaption>
</figure>


Prior to the Condominium Act, apartment buildings could only be rented out or sold in their entirety. Now, for the first time, title could be given to each individual unit, greatly increasing the allowed density of privately owned housing, which was a boon for developers. Condominiums immediately began to crowd out rental building investment: the first condo in Ontario was originally constructed as a rental and was converted to a condominium soon after the law came into effect.[^hanes-2008]

Simply put, building to rent is riskier than building to sell. With condominium projects, construction doesn't begin until a majority of units are pre-sold, which lowers financing costs and the amount of necessary equity. By the time the condo units are occupied, the developer has realized their returns and freed up their equity for use in other projects.[^black-2012] Land values, which account for 15-30% of the cost, are thus driven by the more profitable condominium projects.[^pomeroy-2001]

Since a rental building doesn't generate income until it's completed, it's harder to assess and demonstrate its financial feasability. This means more equity is needed to obtain more expensive financing &mdash; equity which won't be recouped for years or decades to come.[^black-2012] Finally, registering as a condominium allows for a more favourable tax treatment, since multi-residential properties are both discriminated against by GST/HST[^lampert-2016] and municipalities tax them at a higher rate than ownership housing.[^hswg-2001] The average tenant in Ontario pays twice the property tax rate of a homeowner, which for a hypothetical new rental building in Toronto works out to over $200 a month in rent per tenant.[^frpo-2015]

All of this conspires to make profit margins in the multi-residential investment market very narrow. What might be a suitable rate of return for an insurance company looking to operate a rental building is often insufficient for a developer to build a new one.[^hswg-2001] Small shifts in financing terms, land values, taxation and the costs incurred due to delays in the regulatory planning process can have huge impacts in the feasibility of a given project.

The introduction of condos weren't the only thing that changed, though.


<h3>The new taxation regime</h3>

The other significant event occurred in 1972, when the federal government overhauled our income tax system.  Seeking to make our tax system more equitable, close loopholes and reorient which industries it incentivized,[^budget-1971] starting in 1972 and throughout the 70s and 80s, the federal government implemented a series of reforms. 

For the first time, the government began to tax capital gains; but it also changed the rate at which capital costs can be depreciated and it removed the ability to pool losses across rental buildings. It also prevented investors from outside the real estate business from claiming capital cost deductions or offset income via rental lossess, and it altered how and which "soft" construction costs like architect fees, building permits, etc, can be deducted.[^hswg-2001]

In practical terms this means that rental buildings became a far less attractive investment class, especially for small investors. Being able to depreciate a rental building tax-wise at a faster rate than its actual economic depreciation can have a large impact on after-tax returns.[^hswg-2001] Rental buildings become more profitable over time, as inflation and debt repayment lowers ongoing operating costs; before these changes, high-earning professionals could use losses generated by rental properties to offset their higher marginal rates, and they could use liberal capital cost allowance rates to defer income tax until they sold their property.[^miron-1995]

These changes were made with little, if any, regard for their adverse consequences for our housing policy goals,[^clayton-1998] and given that the "Great Apartment Boom" of the 1960s ended shortly thereafter suggests that the effect of these changes was substantial.[^miron-1995]

Additionally, in 1991 the Goods and Services Tax was introduced (and later, harmonized in most provinces), which increased the sales tax burden on new construction by almost 70 per cent.[^enemark-2017] Whereas before only the building materials used in the construction of a rental building had a sales tax, now the full value of the building was subject to a 7 percent charge (though, lower today).[^clayton-1998-2] Renters don't pay GST/HST on their rent, which means that developers are stuck with input credits they can't use, thereby "stranding" tax costs.[^lampert-2016]

Besides our declining rental housing starts, we have one other piece of evidence: the United States' current tax regime as applied to rental buildings is broadly similar to how we did things pre-1972.[^clayton-1998-3] While we can't compare them directly &mdash; Canada and the US are very different places &mdash; consider the example of Seattle and Vancouver. While Vancouver is experiencing a furious condo boom, taking up to 60% of housing starts, the vast majority of new units in Seattle are apartment buildings.[^morales-2017] [^nota-bene]

Of course, there are many other factors and angles we haven't considered. Fluctuating interest rates, demographic trends and surging land prices have large impacts. Tenants are further discriminated against through municipal property taxes and exclusionary zoning restrictions. The list goes on; our housing provisioning system is complicated. 

Yet, given the timing of these changes and how the primary rental market has failed to recover since, it seems fair to say that rent controls qua rent controls are not the main disincentive operating today.

<h3>Not all controls are designed equal</h3>

The point of this article isn't to say that price controls are a paragon of virtue, but instead to critically examine the received wisdom.

Different regions have experiment with different kinds of rent control. The first wave, or generation, of controls were enacted during or after World War II and they imposed nominal rent freezes tied to individual units.[^arnott-1995] In a planned war economy that lacked much in the way of private housing construction, this made a certain amount of sense; but afterwards, only New York City (and some European cities) maintained that wartime policy.

Obviously, a control regime that over time lowers real income below that of real expenditures is a _bad idea_. It transforms rental properties into endless money pits. It's fine, and likely necessary, to subsidize some or other aspect of how we produce or provide housing units in order to achieve our policy goals &mdash; but it's unreasonable to expect that subsidy to be provided to the exclusive detriment of individual landlords. If investors wish to transfer their wealth to tenants they don't need to go through the trouble of erecting a building first.

Commentators criticizing rent controls are quick to conflate all rent regulation with New York City's nominal rent freezes. But that's a false choice. We're not limited to choosing between an unfettered market and a ruinously restrictive price control. When designing a control, we can choose to allow prices to track inflation or costs, to what extent capital investments can be recovered, and at what rate vacant units can reset to what the market will bear (if at all).

A cost-adjusted tenancy control primarily impacts only one area of the development process: the initial lease up of an empty building.[^tait-2017] As long as developers have the ability to adjust for initial mistakes, over the long run the impact on their finances should be reasonable if not minimal.[^ryerson-whatever] Given the long-term nature of multi-residential investment, their business model can be satisfied so long as cashflows keep up with costs and capital expenditures. After all, in a laissez faire but well-functioning market, there is no guarantee that rents will rise above inflation &mdash; and landlords tend to prefer long-term tenants.

Don't just take my word for it. Take GWL Realty Advisors, whose president Paul Finkbeiner was quoted in the _Financial Post_:

> “We believe there is a strong demand for rental apartments and this property will lease up over time,” Finkbeiner said about his Livmore project, [...] “Apartments provide good long-term returns and very low vacancy levels, it’s just one of the best assets classes from a stability point of view.”

>[...]

> GWL seems to think it can work within the new provincial rules. “As a developer, we are building something that will last for 25-50 years that works for tenants,” said Finkbeiner. “We want long-term renters which is also consistent with our investors that are long-term in nature. These buildings go to pay pensions and people’s investments.”

> He noted Ontario still allows rents to be raised to market level once a tenant leaves a unit and capital improvements to buildings can also be passed on to tenants.

> “All we want is a fair rent for our apartments, we do not want above guidelines. We have been able to work within rent controls and still deliver a good product for our investors and tenants,”[^marr-2017]


Recall that the regulation of rent concerns itself with providing security of tenure to tenants. If the economics undergirding multi-residential property investments don't rely on regular above-cost-inflation rent increases, then we should be discussing instead how to properly design a control that does not impede the well-functioning of that business.

<h3>The gap between new and existing rents</h3>

Ultimately, our housing crisis is a matter of income: tenants with low incomes have an _income_ problem, not a housing problem.[^hswg-final] Land prices and other costs, driven by restrictive land use policies and the speculative condo boom, have grown faster than tenant incomes and pushed financial recovery rents beyond what most of the rental population can afford or finds reasonable.

When we talk about preventing the regulation of rents &mdash; bracketing the potential implementation of bad controls &mdash; the concern then is about keeping average rent levels on par with rising land prices. Rents in a newly constructed building must cover their costs. Lately, rents have been increasing by about 11% per year, to an average range of $2.67-2.89 per square foot in 2017. Land values per acre in the Greater Toronto Area have tripled over the last ten years, and consequently new rental building development must target rents in the $3 per square foot range. [^tal-cibc-2]

eeeeh this isn't very good.



So far we've examined the social need for security of tenure, why it requires rent controls, the reasons why tenant protection laws should be considered in their own right, the many ways in which we actively guide and interfere with the housing market, the business models undergirding residential construction, and the evidence suggesting that tackling our undersupply of housing requires policies beyond rent deregulation.

Given that the rent necessary to recoup an investment is largely determined by debt servicing and other operating costs, new projects therefore must target the top end of the market.

Relatively affordable housing, then, occurs because over time, as inflation and mortgage payments decrease operating costs over time, the rent necessary to carry the investment decreases. And, through a process called filtering, new high-end housing creates vacancies lower in the chain as people move on up to occupy new supply. In theory, as the existing housing stock ages and deteriorates, people with higher incomes will tend to prefer newer, higher quality housing.[^brescia-2005-2]

However, as discussed above, the government provides substantial incentives towards homeownership. The people most inclined to pay high end rents are siphoned off from rentals onto the ownership market; if you can afford the mortgage, it usually makes financial sense to buy. And, because the majority of housing stock has already been built and is therefore cheaper, average rents are often quite lower than the rent necessary to recoup new investment.



But why stop at just a tenancy control?

Obviously, a control regime that over time lowers real income below that of real expenditures is a _bad idea_. It's fine, and probably necessary, to subsidize some aspects of renting in order to achieve our housing policy goals, but it's not really rational to expect that to come exclusively at the economic detriment of landlords.

However

In fact, it seems that historically the private market's willingness to build large quantities of rental buildings is a function of the extent they're effective short and medium term _tax shelters_.

<h3>Making the economic case for rent controls</h3>


I'd like to go one step further, and ask: who benefits from unregulated rents &mdash; and why should they?

Starting in the late 1960s, we made a series of policy choices. Condominiums in Ontario were legalized in 1967, and we modified our income and sales tax systems in ways that strongly discourage private capital from flowing into private rental apartments. Meanwhile, by the mid 1990s we almost completely stopped investing in public housing strategies.

Our population has kept growing, though. Compiling data from the CMHC and a City of Toronto report, I produced a graph that illustrates the ways in which our housing mix is shifting:

A little under half of Toronto's residents rent and this percentage has remained stable since 1971. Since primary rentals have remained stagnant, this means that the growth in tenant population has been absorded by the secondary rental market.[^toronto-2006] To the best of our knowledge, the secondary rental market houses a bit under half of Toronto's tenants.[^cmhc-2016] 

By 2016, it was estimated that 34% of all condos were destined to be rented out.[^gadon-2017] Who buys condos and why?

In 1990, 24% of Toronto tenants reported being in core housing need and by 2011 we measured 32%.
