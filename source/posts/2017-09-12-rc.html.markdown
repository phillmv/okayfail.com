title: Actually, Rent Control Is Great
draft: true

<h3>## THIS IS A DRAFT, please do not share.</h3>

In April, the government of Ontario decided to extend rent control to every dwelling in the province, as opposed to just buildings constructed before 1991.

Different jurisdictions have overlapping definitions of "rent control". What Ontario engages in is described by some academics and regions as a tenancy rent control, or rent stabilization. It works like this: once a year, your landlord can raise your monthly rent only up to a guideline pegged to inflation, or inflation plus 3% if their costs have spiked or they made improvements to the unit. Between tenants, landlords are free to price rents at whatever the market will bear.[^ltb-2017]

This prompted a lot of commentary, ranging from [benign skepticism](http://tvo.org/article/current-affairs/the-next-ontario/ontario-needs-a-rental-rethink-but-should-tread-carefully) to [vigorous condemnation](https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/real-estate/toronto/new-ontario-rent-control-rules-exact-opposite-of-what-is-needed-analyst-warns/article34569276/). The chorus sounded like this:

Against all common sense, the province is handing its cities a poisoned chalice: it is textbook economics that price controls sharply reduce the value of new construction.[^gee-2017]  Under rent control, the quantity and quality of available rental units will fall as developers are less incentivized to build or invest in rental properties &mdash; all of which exacerbates any price crunch.[^tal-2017] The fact is, rent control would largely help high-end renters in a high-end market, since most units built after the rent control exemption are condos. It’s tough to see how it would accomplish much except transferring money from unit owners to their tenants.[^selley] Instead, the province should be tackling the root of the problem &mdash; the supply of new housing units in Toronto et al is not keeping up with demand.[^thesun]

I find these takes range from the unconvincing to the disingenuous. Our housing delivery system is complex. We significantly intervene, subsidize and shape the funding and price mechanisms through which new housing is produced. We also regulate our housing markets in order to correct market inefficiencies, to prevent people from being exploited, and to change incentive structures to deliver outcomes we have deemed necessary or correct.  The regulation of rent, like many other kinds of regulation, is a response to market failure.

Toronto is in the grips of a housing crisis. A speculative real estate boom has priced out ownership for low and medium-income people,[^cbc-squeeze] and it's easy to find stories about sitting tenants seeing their rents jump by hundreds of dollars.[^cbc-martin] [^tgam-jaafari] [^mercer-2017] When demand for rental units is high and vacancy rates are low, landlords have a lot of power over their tenants &mdash; and all the more if they can increase rents at will. The absence of controls allows the unscrupulous to evict tenants exercising their rights, and the eager to arbitrarily extract more money for the same service they were providing before. I've been a renter in Toronto for almost a decade now, and I've watched rents my neighbourhood(s) climb substantially; whenever I've had to look for housing, the uncertainty of living in a uncontrolled apartment has weighed heavily on my mind.

For this reason, removing the exemption seemed like a no-brainer. Yet, hardly any skeptics writing on the topic engage with the social problem that a rent control seeks to solve: the provision of security of tenure. People who rent deserve to enjoy long-term stability in their housing. Not only do tenants have a moral right to remain in neighbourhoods they themselves have helped prosper, but it is also in our larger economic interest that they do so. If the success of our cities requires us to shift away from homeownership, then we must create the conditions for our communities to succeed with them.

Rent controls, of course, don't create new housing units nor do they divert the speculative investment dollars driving up prices. But critics obscure the fact that rent controls vary markedly from region to region in their design and implementation. A careful examination reveals that rent regulations like the one in Ontario don't actually have the pernicious effects commonly attributed to them. 

If we are indeed serious about tackling our housing crisis, and protecting people from suffering from its effects, it's time to face the facts: there are other, far more serious, disincentives and barriers removing supply from our housing markets &mdash; and we need to seriously tweak the many ways we intervene in them.

<h2>The case against rent control</h2>
<h3>Vanishing rental supply</h3>

When we talk about rental supply, we typically distinguish between the "primary" rental market, where professional landlords operate purpose built rental buildings, and the "secondary" rental market, where individuals rent out their basement apartments or spare condos.[^toronto-2006]

We typically favour primary rentals because professional, full-time landlords are more capable of absorbing maintenance costs, and are far likelier to provide long-term accomodation. Condo units have a tendency to get flipped, and basement apartments are often vacated for the owner's own use.

The primary rental housing sector has been in a state of crisis for about forty years.[^smith-1983] Beginning in the 1970s, the construction of new private purpose-built rental buildings collapsed. If throughout Ontario in 1969 there were 27,543 new, unassisted rental building starts, by the mid 1980s we were building under 5,000.[^smith-1988] Private developers began to leave the market and, though their departure was initially compensated by government assisted housing starts, before long the provincial and federal governments began to withdraw funding as well.[^toronto-2006]

<h3>Controls in Ontario</h3>
Around the same time, new tenant protection legislation was being introduced and by 1975 rent controls were in effect throughout the province. At the beginning rents were essentially fixed in nominal terms, which in a high inflation era meant their real values quickly declined. New construction was at first exempted, and then not; only by 1986 were the guidelines changed such that rent adjustments became tied to inflation.[^smith-1988]


The technical argument against controls goes like this. Rent control artificially lowers the income that landlords can expect to receive from rental properties. This depresses any motivation investors may have for responding to demand by creating new rental buildings. Meanwhile, lower rent costs relative to ownership encourage more people to stay in the rental market, which creates more demand for fewer units. A control imposed in response to market failure will therefore exacerbate it.

Rent controls don't just affect new construction, and therefore new tenants; they can have stark effects on existing units as well. Faced with a control where increases in rent grow at a rate slower than the costs of maintaining the property, existing landlords are strongly encouraged to let their properties deteriorate, or convert them to condominiums. 

We're blessed that Ontario is a relatively well studied jurisdiction. Lawrence Smith, in a widely cited[^widely-cited] 1988 study of Ontario's rental market, argued that all of the above occurred after the province instituted its 1975 rent controls. Smith found that real rents and capital values of rental units collapsed, and that Toronto lost 11% of its moderately priced rental housing stock through conversions, demolition and eviction through renovation. By 1986, vacancy rates were an extremely low 0.1%, but the market was unable to add supply; to quote,

> In a normally functioning, uncontrolled housing market a vacancy rate below the natural (or equilibrium) rate triggers an increase in real rents and real capital values. This in turn stimulates increased expenditures on the existing stock and increased new construction. Rent controls break this connection between low vacancies and large housing expenditures, and thereby impede the market adjustment necessary to satisfy the excess demand.

> ...

> The timing and severity of the decline in rental housing starts, especially in government unassisted rental starts, and the contrast with the pattern of single detached, semi-detached and duplex starts suggest rent controls substantially reduced the volume of new rental contruction in Ontario. 

> [Other factors such as less favourable demographics, rising interest rates, and increased tenant protection may have exacerbated the decline in rental starts, but rent controls appear to be the primary factor.] [^smith-1988]

<h2>Revisiting Ontario's experience</h2>


Let's take this for granted, then. Rent controls appear to be the primary factor. This paper was published some time ago. What has happened since?

 In 1992, the Rent Control Act limited the kind of capital expenditures landlords could recover via rent increases and once again exempted new rental housing from rent control for a period of 5 years.[^miron-1995] In 1998, the Harris government initiated the most dramatic change since their introduction: capital expenditures could now be fully recovered, vacancy decontrol was introduced for existing units, and rents in new buildings were permanently deregulated.[^rent-control-city-report] [^smith-2003] [^rta-2006]

This means that for over twenty years we've lived in a regime where new construction lacked any kind of rent control. If rent controls by themselves are the main disincentive acting on the volume of new rental construction, how do we expect the market to have responded?

Compiling data provided by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), I was able to extend <a href="#fref:fig1">figure 1</a> up to the present day:

<figure id="fref:fig2">
<a href="/img/Ontario Housing Starts 1969-2016 Bar Chart.png"><img src="/img/Ontario Housing Starts 1969-2016 Bar Chart.png"></a>
<figcaption>
<b>Figure 2.</b> Ontario housing starts by intended market 1969-2016. Note that data from 1987 onwards is restricted to areas with over 10,000 people, and therefore undercounts total starts.</sup>
</figcaption>
</figure>

During the 1969-1974 pre-rent control period for which we have data, there were on average 32,704 unassisted rental starts per year, or about 30% of total production. From 2009 to 2016, a period without any rent controls, Ontario averaged 5,147 new rental unit starts or a mere 10% of total supply. 

If rent controls were the primary factor inhibiting new construction today, then surely we'd expect to see the opposite. Yet primary rental starts remain depressed.  Opponents of controls argue that developers continued to price in the risk of their reintroduction,[^brescia-2005] but judged over the course of almost a generation that argument is wanting.

One downside of Smith's 1988 study is that it does not control for demographics, interest rates, recessions, etc. Rent controls could have caused record low vacancy rates by inducing higher demand &mdash; but 1986 was also when the majority of the baby boom cohort hit the prime rental occupancy age range of 20-35.[^rental-demographics] This is no easy task, mind you; reviewing the literature, it's a bit of an open question whether we possess the empirical data or theoretical capacity to do so properly.[^lind-2003]

It's unsatisfying to merely note that the existing hypothesis doesn't fit new data. Ideally, we should be able to supply our own causal narrative. Why do we build fewer units than we did during a period of harsh rent control? For that matter, why aren't we building them like we used to in the 1960s? 

What else is happening?

<h3>The rise of the condominium</h3>

I was able to identify two other big shifts that significantly impacted our housing supply. 

The first happened in 1967, when Ontario legalized condominiums and created a new form of property ownership &mdash; thereby substantially altering the economics behind multi-residential buildings.

<figure id="fref:fig3">
<a href="/img/Ontario Housing Starts 1969-2016 Bar Chart With Condos.png"><img src="/img/Ontario Housing Starts 1969-2016 Bar Chart With Condos.png"></a>
<figcaption>
<b>Figure 3.</b> Figure 2, but distinguishing condos from single, detached and other housing.
</figcaption>
</figure>

Looking at this data at a regional level is misleading, I think, since the growth rate and attributes of housing markets vary from subregion to subregion. As you can see from the housing mix in figure 3, Ontario was still aggressively subdividing and sprawling. With an abundance of available freehold land it's possible that, looking at province-wide data, we might understate the impact of condominiums. How would this look like in an already built-up area where by and large higher density developments are the only option? 

For that reason, I dug up and plotted recent and historical data from Toronto:[^note-digging]

<figure id="fref:fig4">
<a href="/img/Toronto Housing Completions 1981-2016 - bar chart2.png"><img src="/img/Toronto Housing Completions 1981-2016 - bar chart2.png"></a>

</figure>


In 2012 Jill Black wrote a great research paper regarding the financing and economics of multi-residential housing development. She explores the incentives property developers act on and the disincentives they suffer as they choose projects to work on, and it's well worth a read. According to her research, in a nutshell, building to rent is riskier and less profitable than building to sell.[^black-2012]

Prior to the Condominium Act, apartment buildings could only be rented out or sold in their entirety. Now, for the first time, title could be given to each individual unit, greatly increasing the allowed density of privately owned housing. Condominiums immediately began to crowd out rental building investment: the first condo in Ontario was originally constructed as a rental and was converted to a condominium soon after the law came into effect.[^hanes-2008]

Developers find building for the ownership market more attractive because with condominium projects construction doesn't begin until a majority of units are pre-sold to qualified buyers. This early-on cash stream reduces the amount of necessary debt, lowers interest repayment costs and makes it easier to obtain financing. By the time the condo units are occupied, the developer has realized their returns and freed up their equity for use in other projects.[^black-2012-2] 

In contrast, a rental building doesn't generate income until it's completed and therefore it's harder to assess and demonstrate its financial feasability. This means more equity is needed to obtain more expensive, CMHC insured, financing &mdash; equity which won't be recouped for years or decades to come.[^black-2012-2] Land values, which account for 15-30% of the cost, are thus driven by the more profitable condominium projects.[^pomeroy-2001] In a way, the development of condominiums in desirable locations can lead to a kind of "Dutch disease", whereby the more profitable developments support an increase in costs and prices that make other, lower margin, projects unprofitable by comparison.[^lind-2003-2]

Finally, registering as a condominium allows for a more favourable tax treatment, since multi-residential properties are discriminated against by both our sales tax regime[^lampert-2016] and by municipal property tax rates which are set higher than ownership housing.[^hswg-2001] The average tenant in Ontario pays twice the property tax rate of a homeowner, which for a hypothetical new rental building in Toronto works out to over $200 a month in rent per tenant.[^frpo-2015]

All of this conspires to make profit margins in the multi-residential investment market very narrow. What might be a suitable rate of return for an insurance company looking to operate a rental building is often insufficient for a developer to build a new one.[^hswg-2001] Small shifts in financing terms, land values, costs incurred due to delays in the regulatory planning process, and taxation can have a serious impact on the feasibility of a given project.

The notion that condos crowded out rental investment is compelling, but by itself doesn't really exculpate rent controls. What if controls were just enough of a disincentive to shift the equilibrium? 

<h3>The end of real estate tax shelters</h3>

The other significant event occurred in 1972, when the federal government overhauled our income tax system.  Seeking to make taxation more equitable, close loopholes and reorient which industries it incentivized,[^budget-1971] starting in 1972 and throughout the 70s and 80s, the federal government implemented a series of reforms. 

NOTE TO ADD BIT ON HOW IT PRIVILEGED HOMEOWNERSHIP from fraser/smith 1977

For the first time, the government began to tax capital gains; but it also changed the rate at which capital costs can be depreciated and it removed the ability to pool losses across rental buildings. It also prevented investors from outside the real estate business from claiming capital cost deductions or offset income via rental lossess, and it altered how and which "soft" construction costs like architect fees, building permits, etc, can be deducted.[^hswg-2001] [^note-on-taxes]

In practical terms this meant that rental buildings became a far less attractive investment class, especially for small investors. Being able to depreciate a rental building tax-wise at a faster rate than its actual economic depreciation can have a large impact on after-tax returns.[^hswg-2001] Rental buildings become more profitable over time, as inflation and debt repayment lowers ongoing operating costs; before these changes, high-earning professionals could use losses generated by rental properties to offset their higher marginal rates, and they could use liberal capital cost allowance rates to defer income tax until they sold their property.[^miron-1995]

These changes were made with little, if any, regard for their adverse consequences for our housing policy goals,[^clayton-1998] and given that the "Great Apartment Boom" of the 1960s ended shortly thereafter suggests that the effect of these changes was substantial.[^miron-1995]

<b>Figure 4.</b> Note that these categories describe physical structures, i.e. "apartment" includes both duplexes, triplexes, etc and the large towers we today consider synonymous with condominiums. We built more (almost entirely rental) apartment buildings in 1968 than we built (mostly condos) apartment buildings in 2001 (or 2016, for that matter). </sup>
</figcaption>
</figure>

Additionally, in 1991 the Goods and Services Tax was introduced (and later, harmonized in most provinces), which increased the sales tax burden on new construction by almost 70 per cent.[^enemark-2017] Whereas before only the building materials used in the construction of a rental building had a sales tax, now the full value of the building was subject to a 7 percent charge (though, lower today).[^clayton-1998-2] Renters don't pay GST/HST on their rent, which means that developers are stuck with input credits they can't use thereby "stranding" tax costs.[^lampert-2016]


Various Trudeau governments recognized there were consequences from changing the Income Tax Act and tried to do something about it. The Multi-Unit Residential Building incentive (1974-1979, 1981) re-enabled the use of rental investment as a tax shelter. The Assisted Rental Program (1974-1979, 1981) gave subsidized mortgages to developers in exchange for below-market rents. The Canada Rental Supply Program (1981-1984) provided interest-free loans for up to fifteen years. The list goes on.[^goldberg-1985] [^suttor-2009]

Besides our declining rental housing starts, we have one other piece of evidence: the United States' current tax regime as applied to rental buildings is broadly similar to how we did things pre-1972.[^clayton-1998-3] While we can't compare them directly &mdash; Canada and the US are very different places &mdash; consider the example of Seattle and Vancouver. While Vancouver is experiencing a furious condo boom, taking up to 60% of housing starts, the vast majority of new units in Seattle are apartment buildings.[^morales-2017] [^nota-bene]

Of course, there are many other factors and angles we haven't considered. We have not considered or controlled for the huge impacts of fluctuating interest rates, demographic trends, surging land prices, etc. Tenants are further discriminated by municipal property taxes and exclusionary zoning restrictions. 

Our housing provisioning system is complicated &mdash; but given the timing of these changes and how the primary rental market has failed to recover since 1998, it seems fair to say that rent controls qua rent controls are not the main disincentive operating today.

<h2>The economics of rent controls</h2>

The point of this article isn't to say that price controls are a paragon of virtue, but instead to critically examine the received wisdom: the picture is rather murkier than that shown in in the standard textbook analysis.

If Ontario's rent controls probably did not impact the supply of new housing, what else can we say about them? How does this evidence fit into the theoretical basis behind most economists' criticism of rent controls? What evidence do we have from other jurisdictions? What other criticisms are misguided &mdash; and which ones are well founded? Finally, what are rent controls actually good for?

<!-- Here is what I will not be arguing for. Some think that rent controls assist in the preservation of affordability, or have virtuous redistributional effects. I believe these views are incorrect. For one, there are more stable and politically durable ways to redistribute income. As to the other, absent a radical reorientation of land rights the cost of new supply remains tied to the yoke of interest rates and land prices &mdash; and therefore a price control on rents will not help us with regard to new supply.-->

<h3>A theoretical overview</h3>

One major problem with this discussion is that there are actually many qualitatively different kinds of rent controls, which different regions have experimented with over different periods of time. When designing a control, we can decide when and how prices increase, whether they track inflation or another indicator, whether capital expenditures can be recoverered, at what rate vacant units can reset to what the market will bear (if at all), and so on.[^nota-bene-2]

Richard Arnott, in a widely read paper from 1995, broadly categorizes rent control policy into two distinct phases. The first wave, or generation, of controls were enacted around World War II and they imposed nominal rent freezes tied to individual units. In a planned war economy that lacked much in the way of private housing construction, this made a certain amount of sense; but afterwards most regions dismantled their controls and only New York City (and some European cities) maintained that wartime policy.[^arnott-1995] 

The second generation began in the 1970s as rent control ordinances were passed in Boston, Los Angeles, San Francisco and in a variety of towns in California, Massachussets, New Jersey, New York, etc. The struture of Canadian federalism saw these policies accumulate at the provincial level, and during this period ten provinces also enacted rent controls (though most have since abandoned them). These policies "differed significantly from the first-generation rent control programs" and usually allowed automatic increases in rent, the passing through of additional costs, and other like-minded provisions.[^arnott-1995]

Separating controls into "hard" and "soft" is not especially useful, though. Hans Lind, writing in 2001, goes on to define five distinct functional types of rent control. In his view, regulations can protect sitting tenants from being charged above-market rents (type A), or from increases in rent unattached to increases in costs (type B). Alternatively, regulations can instead bind to units and prevent landlords anywhere from charging above-market rents (type C), prevent rapid inflation by smoothing increases (type D) or, finally, prevent rents from ever reaching actual market prices (type E).[^lind-2001] [^note-on-lind]

The takeway here is that when we talk about regulations, we have to be specific since their goals, mechanisms and therefore impacts are going to be different. New York City's rent controls, which Lind identifies as an extreme version of a type E control,[^lind-2001] are the most famous and well studied example, and consequently critics are quick to conflate all rent regulation with the kind experienced there.[^widely-cited-2] That tendency is unfortunate, since in doing so they perform a sleight of hand: New York City's complex and overlapping rent regulations were enacted at different points of time,[^nycrgb-2016] and therefore its experience is idiosyncratic and unlikely to be directly applicable to other cities.

Of course, they're not wrong to criticize nominal rent freezes: obviously, a control regime that over time lowers real income below that of real expenditures is a _bad idea_. It transforms rental properties into endless money pits. It's fine, and likely necessary, to subsidize some or other aspect of how we produce or provide housing units in order to achieve our policy goals &mdash; but it's unreasonable to expect that subsidy to be provided to the exclusive detriment of individual landlords. If investors wish to transfer their wealth to tenants they don't need to go through the trouble of erecting a building.  

But that's a false choice. We're not limited to between an unfettered market and a ruinously restrictive price control. 

When economists discuss losses in efficiency, allocation and welfare, they're comparing our real world with an idealized, frictionless, "perfectly competitive" market where landlords compete to produce fungible, homogenous housing units, there are no externalities, every actor possesses perfect information, and so on. In this view, a landlord faced with increased demand is free to increase prices and profits accordingly. Abnormally high profits, though, attract other potential landlords who by virtue of adding to the supply of apartments will then drive down their prices.

Given a perfect market any sketch on a napkin will show that if prices are not allowed to rise with demand then new entrants will stay put, supply will not increase, and shortages will follow. However, given perfect competition, the market prices any landlord can fetch will over the long run equal their marginal cost, i.e. the amortized cost of building and operating a housing unit plus the landlord's opportunity cost. Put another way, in a _well functioning market_ it's more or less unreasonable to expect the rents any given landlord is able to extract will grow much faster than costs and inflation.[^arnott-monopoly]

The implication here is that while absolute price ceilings can be and are harmful there is no obvious reason why price _smoothing_ such that increases match but do not exceed costs should have a strong effect on the incentive to create new rental housing.[^arnott-2003] Trivially, investment in multi-residential buildings is a function of the cost of equity, cost of financing and net operating income; developers may invest in a project expecting significant growth in their net operating income, but in a competitive market that is a rather risky assumption. Therefore, even in the absence of rent controls, projects by and large must be cashflow positive given rents available immediately post-construction.[^black-2012-4]

As far as new supply is concerned we can therefore conceive of a non-harmful rent control: if prices increase with costs and inflation, landlord cashflows should largely be unaffected. It's easy to see why: a cost-adjusted tenancy rent control primarily impacts only one area of the development process: the initial lease up of an empty building.[^tait-2017] Given the long-term nature of multi-residential investment, and provided with the ability to adjust for initial mistakes, over the long run the impact on their finances should be reasonable if not minimal &mdash; and their business model can be satisfied so long as cashflows keep up with costs and capital expenditures.[^macfarlane-2001]  

You don't have to take my word for it. Take GWL Realty Advisors, whose president Paul Finkbeiner was quoted in the _Financial Post_:

> “We believe there is a strong demand for rental apartments and this property will lease up over time,” Finkbeiner said about his Livmore project, [...] “Apartments provide good long-term returns and very low vacancy levels, it’s just one of the best assets classes from a stability point of view.”

>[...]

> GWL seems to think it can work within the new provincial rules. “As a developer, we are building something that will last for 25-50 years that works for tenants,” said Finkbeiner. “We want long-term renters which is also consistent with our investors that are long-term in nature. These buildings go to pay pensions and people’s investments.”

> He noted Ontario still allows rents to be raised to market level once a tenant leaves a unit and capital improvements to buildings can also be passed on to tenants.

> “All we want is a fair rent for our apartments, we do not want above guidelines. We have been able to work within rent controls and still deliver a good product for our investors and tenants,”[^marr-2017]

<h3>The kind of rent control Ontario has is rather soft</h3>


Recall that Ontario's current rent control regime pegs rents to inflation, does not control rents between tenants, and allows cost pass through.[^depressing] Lind categorized it as a type B control,[^lind-2001] and elsewhere it is variously called a kind of tenancy rent control or rent stabilization.

We saw above that though Ontario's previous rent control regimes may have been harmful, they were unlikely to be the main disincentives acting on supply &mdash; and especially so since 1998, when vacancies were decontrolled and new construction was exempted entirely. Considering the need to compare apples-to-apples, what other evidence can we draw for the impacts of type B rent controls?

Consider Manitoba, whose regulation scheme is broadly similar[^note-on-mb] and has regulated rents since roughly 1976. Hugh Grant, writing in 2011, argues that there is no evidence that Manitoba's rent regulation program had a negative effect on the supply of new, or maintenance of existing, rental properties. Manitoba at the time was experiencing a low vacancy rate, which Grant attributed to a rapid influx of immigration, and a relatively inelastic supply due to large planning-to-completion time lags and uncertainty about future rates of population growth.[^grant-2011]

In New Jersey, over one hundred municipalities have enacted their own rent controls. Each city implemented their regulation differently, but by and large they all permit automatic increases, passing on capital improvements, etc; almost half also engage in vacancy decontrol. In 2015 Joshua Ambrosius et al used the 2010 United States Census and compared the regulated cities with unregulated cities. They found that, once they controlled for other factors, New Jersey rent control policies had no statistical impact on rental quality, rental supply, property appreciation or foreclosure rates in the cities that enacted them.[^ambrosius-2015]

In fact, tenancy rent controls seem to barely control rents at all. Earlier this year Graham Haines analyzed Ontario's rent regulations and developed a model that estimated that "the discounted cumulative income earned by the rent controlled building was between 98.5% and 99.0% of that earned by the non-rent controlled building".[^haines-2017] 

This finding is corroborated by both the Manitoba and the New Jersey study cited above. In New Jersey, median rents in rent controlled cities were found to be roughly the same as rents in non-controlled cities.[^ambrosius-2015-2] In Manitoba, Grant argues "there is no evidence that rent regulations have restricted rents below what would prevail in a perfectly-competitive market under equilibrium conditions".[^grant-2011-2]

Though they do not quite confirm to my criteria above, two other studies are worth mentioning. Frank Denton et al, in a 1993 report commissioned by the CMHC, developed an econometric model and conducted an extensive empirical investigation of the impact of rent controls on Canadian housing markets. They concluded that "there is no evidence that controls influence the long-run rate of increase of rents", nor did they impact housing starts or maintenance though they may lower vacancy rates.[^denton-1993] Celia Lazzarin analyzed rent regulations in British Columbia from 1974 to 1984 for her 1990 master's thesis. She found that basically there were too many confounding variables (demographics, unemployment, interest and inflation rates, migration, etc) to attribute the declines in Vancouver's rental supply solely to rent controls.[^lazzarin-1990]

<!--<h3>Allocation concerns are misplaced</h3>

I would like to address a few other criticisms. 

The first, advanced most notably by Edward Glaeser et al in 2003, is that by keeping rent prices down rent controls prevent the Pareto efficient allocation of housing to those who most value them &mdash; and that these misallocation costs can create greater social losses than the mere undersupply of housing. The canonical sympathetic example is that of a lonely widow occupying a three bedroom long past her actual need for the extra space. Glaeser et al created an econometric model whereby they rank preferences in housing size by socio-economic groups living in Hartford, CT and in Chicago, IL, and compare them to the same groups living in Manhattan. They conclude that about 20 percent of apartments in New York City are misallocated.[^glaeser-2003]

I think this analysis is rather puzzling, for a few reasons. First, the observation that tenants in Hartford, CT will have a larger apartment than their socio-economic peers living in an apartment building with more than five units in Manhattan seems trivial and meaningless given the variation in housing stock, city amenities, etc. Second, when applying their analysis to their placebo markets they find that, contrary to their expectations, Chicago and Hartford also show signs of misallocation &mdash; and for that reason caution readers against embracing their results "too enthusiastically".[^glaeser-2003]

Most importantly, the entire analysis encodes a normative assumption that property rights should override tenure rights, and we can most vividly imagine this by applying the same inference to ownership housing. Suppose instead that the hypothetical lonely widow owns her unit outright and it becomes hard to imagine an equivalent paper arguing that her property rights should be abrogated and the widow forcibly evicted in order to improve the allocation of housing. Indeed, Glaeser et al also find that their sample of NYC owned units have a higher degree of misallocation than their placebo groups in Chicago or Hartford &mdash; but this seems to elicit no discussion or need for a policy response.[^glaeser-2003] [^nota-bene-3]

Quickly, a similar argument is made elsewhere with regard to the cost of mismatching labour to jobs; rent controls disincentivize job seekers from moving closer to work, since their housing costs will likely increase. I think this is also puzzling, for the same reason as above: this analysis is not applied to homeownership. Transaction and moving costs are if anything higher for homeowners, and the extent to which incentivizing homeownership is the sole driving focus of much of our housing policy apparatus renders this argument moot.

It's not clear to me why we should apply these arguments to one kind of housing tenure and not another.-->

<h3>Some downsides are real, though</h3>

There is one noticeable disadvantage to a tenancy rent control: in tight markets the delta between long term tenant rates and market rates can grow rather large. 

Because rents reset between tenants, landlords therefore may try to select for shorter term tenancies (i.e. by preferring students over families) and building smaller units. Lawrence Smith wrote about this in 2003, as well as Richard Arnott.[^smith-2003] [^arnott-2003] I think we can ameliorate that by moderately controlling vacancies, paired with a temporary exemption for new construction. If inter-tenancy rent increases are restricted by 10 or even 5% over inflation we reduce the incentive for high tenancy turnover, smooth rapid price increases across the market, and preserve the normal incentive structure described above.[^vacancy-control] However, rent prices over time would still approach market rates.

Keeping some rents below market prices has another detrimental effect: it encourages property owners to economically evict their tenants via renovations or to convert to unregulated forms of tenure. Lawrence Smith's 1988 paper mentions this for Toronto, and earlier I cited McFarlane.[^macfarlane-2001] I've chosen to highlight two other papers. David Sims, writing in 2007, examined what happened after Massachussets ended rent controls in 1994. He argues that units in previously controlled areas became 6-7 percentage points more likely to be rented out, i.e. that units were kept from the rental market.[^sims-2007]

Rebecca Diamond et al, in a freshly published paper, leveraged a uniquely rich dataset. In 1994, the city of San Francisco extended its rent regulation to buildings with 4 or fewer rental units built before 1980 (about 30% of the rental stock). Combining a private data provider with property records, they were able to follow individual San Francisco tenants occupying regulated and unregulated housing units from 1994 to the present day. They found "that rent-controlled buildings were almost 10 percent more likely to convert to a condo or a Tenancy in Common".[^diamond-2017]

There is some reason to doubt these numbers prima facie, since converted housing units remain part of the housing stock &mdash; and a large percentage of condominiums get rented out to tenants without this necessarily being reflected in most housing data sources (though it seems that Diamond's dataset mostly controls for this). It may be more accurate to say that primary rental units are being converted to ownership _and_ the secondary rental market. 

In addition, California's Ellis Act creates a relatively permissive environment for conversions. Contrast with Massachussets: Sims found that "rent decontrol is associated with an 8 percentage point increase in the probability of a unit being a condominium", presumably since conversion restrictions were lifted.[^sims-2007] Nevertheless, it seems fair to conclude that keeping units below market rates exacerbates the incentive towards selling them or redeveloping them.

Reading these papers I can't help but think that the actual problem has more to do with rising land values and the lack of new supply. That regular, continuous growth in market rates makes conversions attractive is not surprising. San Francisco's property values have appreciated by 550% over the last thirty years,[^mclaughlin-2016] and it rather famously doesn't build much in the way of new housing despite creating lots of well paid jobs.[^torres-2017]

<h3>Affordability is about the land</h3>

The essential observation here is that rent controls cause a decline in rentals not because they are rendered unprofitable but because they are crowded out by ownership housing and other, more profitable uses. Today's land prices set the floor on the rent tomorrow's new supply needs to extract, and so it seems to me that when we talk about letting rent prices float to market rates we imply that landlords deserve to capture the growth in value immediately rather than just through capital gains. But to the extent that land values in certain cities are a function of inelastic supply, capital markets and low interest rates, that seems like a strange reason to support a transfer from tenants to landlords.

Ultimately, our housing crisis is a matter of income: tenants with low incomes have an _income_ problem, not a housing problem.[^hswg-final] [^brescia-2005-3] Land prices and other costs, driven by restrictive land use policies and the speculative boom, have grown faster than tenant incomes and pushed financial recovery rents beyond what most of the rental population can afford or finds reasonable. While land prices continue to grow above inflation or wages, maintaining affordable housing stock will continue to be a challenge.

 In the absence of subsidy, the private sector is unlikely to build new rental housing for the low end of the market. Though the profitability of building modest cost ownership housing in large volumes can approach that of smaller quantities of high end ownership housing, the same is not true for affordable rentals. It costs only slightly less to build an affordable rental, compared to building high end, but the resulting income stream is substantially smaller.[^hswg-2001]
 
 Relatively affordable privately developed housing, then, occurs because as inflation and mortgage payments decrease carrying costs over time the rent necessary to carry a rental investment decreases. And, through a process called filtering, new high-end housing creates vacancies lower in the chain as people move on up to occupy new supply. In theory, as the existing housing stock ages and deteriorates, people with higher incomes will tend to prefer newer, higher quality housing.[^brescia-2005-2] In practice, as housing preferences change and formerly 'downtrodden' areas become trendy, the filtering chain can get interrupted as higher-income people renovate and move into formerly lower-income areas.

A well-designed rent control over the long run allows rents to reach market rates and therefore does not directly help with affordability. A well-designed rent control allows landlords to pass through capital expenditures and somewhat incentivizes renovations, and therefore does not directly help with gentrification. 

What are rent controls good for, then?

<h2>Security of tenure is great</h2>

Rent regulations do seem to be effective at keeping current tenants in their homes. 

For example, back in 1998, the _Economist_ reported that in Cambridge "nearly 40% of tenants in regulated flats moved out after rent control ended", and that "decontrolled rents overall jumped by more than 50% between 1994 and 1997".[^economist-1998]  Sims, referenced above and discussing the same decontrol event, found that "decontrol is associated with a decrease of renter stays of 1.84 years", which is rather "sizeable when compared to the mean renter stay of 6 years in the sample".[^sims-2007] This is framed as a loss of efficiency in terms of labour mobility, but I'm not sure it's that cut and dry. 

Most striking is the result from Diamond's research. Diamond et al found that tenants receiving rent control were up to 20% likelier to remain in their apartments and that "absent rent control essentially all of those incentivized to stay in their apartments would have otherwise moved out of San Francisco". Diamond frames rent regulations as a kind of insurance against rent increases whose cost in practice is bourne by all tenants, as the restriction in supply causes unregulated or vacant rents to rise more than they would have otherwise. She then argues that providing this insurance function directly as a government subsidy or tax credit would be more efficient.[^diamond-2017] 

But why should we provide this subsidy in the first place? The literature on rent controls has much to say about efficient allocation, property values, supply, demand, etc but unfortunately economists and other commentators rarely have much to say about security of tenure. In a 2003 paper reviewing tenancy rent controls, Arnott noted that

>Almost all economists lead financially secure lives and were raised by parents who emphasized responsibility and self-discipline. They have little or no personal experience with the insecurity that is ever-present in the lives of the less advantaged—those from dysfunctional families, those not raised to middle-class values, and the less able—who tend to live from one paycheck to the next. Not surprisingly, therefore, most economists ignore or underemphasize the importance of security of tenure in rental housing, even though it is consistently second only to affordability on the list of concerns raised by tenant groups.[^arnott-2003]

Security of tenure is the notion that tenants have the right to occupy a home and be protected from being forced to leave against their will. By way of contrast, a homeowner's right to security of tenure is usually taken for granted; so long as they're current on mortgage payments (if any), taxes, etc, a homeowner is protected from involuntary eviction. That security is not absolute, of course: they may be expropriated or rising interest rates may render them unable to afford their home, but by and large "they cannot be forced out at the whim of someone else".[^yee-1989]

By default in most common law jurisdictions tenants do not have this security. They may be denied a renewal of their lease, they may be subject to seizure by landlords who simply dislike them, or they may be 'economically evicted' due to arbitrary increases in their rent. As a result, providing tenants with security of tenure entails not only that we ensure that housing units are safe for inhabitation and well maintained, but also that we prevent landlords from exercising their economic power over tenants in undue ways. 

But why should we intervene in our housing markets and regulate them to achieve this end? In a perfect market, tenants should be on average free from arbitrary increases or poorly maintained units due to the emancipating effect of competition. David Hulchanksi, writing in 1984, argued that our housing markets routinely fail to provide those conditions, and that they are likely to continue to do so.[^hulchanski-30-later] Faced with a constant state of market failure, and the broad recognition that market efficiencies aren't always our top priority, it becomes appropriate to design and tweak and an appropriate set of regulations.[^hulchanksi-1984]

And why shouldn't we intervene? After all, we substantially subsidize private ownership. Its relative attractiveness as an investment is the direct result of government policy. The relative scarcity of land via exclusionary zoning is a government policy. Financial liberalization and the coupling of capital markets to home financing was the result of government policy. 

Most suggestions for how to improve the affordability of rental buildings involve either direct subsidies or the reinstitution of tax shelters, and the extent to which they are built at all today would not happen without the direct intervention of a government agency, the CMHC. Our housing markets do not exist in a state of nature. 

<!--For better or for worse, renting is poised for a comeback. Back in March, CIBC's Benjamin Tal wrote that "the GTA market is fast approaching a full-blown affordability crisis" as a surge in demand due to "a notable increase in speculative and flipping activity" is pricing out most people from ownership markets. He argues that therefore municipalities must "rethink the role of rental activity in the region’s housing mix".[^tal-rent-2017] Though I am prone to quibble with some of his preferred solutions,[^quibbling] it seems correct to observe that current macro economic conditions are rushing us towards a new era of unobtainable ownership prices.-->

<!--
housing markets tied to capital markets; implicit expectation behind allowing rents to float to market rates is that landlords deserve to capture growth in value immediately rather than just thru capital gains. why should we transfer income from tenants to landlords on the basis of low interest rates?

rc _is_ effective at keeping people in their homes, though. Sims found that ppl stayed on avg another 1.6 years; Diamond  found that tenants receiving rent control were up to 20% likelier to remain in their apartments and that "absent rent control essentially all of those incentivized to stay in their apartments would have otherwise moved out of San Francisco."  Diamond argues that it'd be simpler to just have the government insure tenants directly but that's still a weird transfer to landlords. 

the essential observation here is that rc causes rentals to decline _in so far that they are crowded out_ as investments by ownership housing and other uses. However, we substantially subsidize ownership housing. 

The important part here to consider is while the full set of consequences from our present situation may be unintentional it did not occur by accident.  the relative attractiveness of ownership housing is a government policy; the relative scarcity of land via exclusionary zoning is a government policy; rental buildings as it stands today would not be built at all without the direct intervention of a government agency.[black, cmhc insurance rates]

if rental buildings are profitable to the extent that they are _tax shelters_ answer then is to tweak how we intervene.

a report commissioned by the new zealand housing comission summarized the impacts of housing tenure and the results are bleak: tenants have poorer health, live in areas with more crime, take longer to recover from unemployment, etc.

the main thing that is different is security of tenure. security of tenure is a public good: everyone benefits while any given person's security of tenure does not exclude anyone else's.-->


<!--
Vacancy decontrolled regimes like ours have a much more limited effect since they allow average rents to approach market rates over time. A 2011 study of Manitoba's rent regulation, which is broadly similar to Ontario's, found that  [NOTE ON HOW MANITOBA's [RC HERE](http://www.gov.mb.ca/cca/pubs/rental_report)] <h3>The future is renting</h3>

therefore what impacts do we cause on tenants? the absence of security of tenure is an externality we push onto tenants.

<h3>Rent is an unproductive use of income</h3>

If the investment strategy underwriting purpose built rental buildings doesn't require above cost price inflation &mdash; i.e. cashflows after a building's lease-up must provide a certain rate of return on equity &mdash; then it's worth thinking about who benefits from increased rents.

Market prices are an important signal that impacts new construction, in so far that rents derived from new buildings must be comesurate with newer, higher land prices. A developer seeking to make an investment, given their risk, needs some way of estimating rates of return.

However, increases in rent for sitting tenants due solely to increases in demand are in effect transfers from tenants to landlords that do not directly impact new supply. Above inflation increases in rental income does improve the profitability of a given investment, but over the short term or even medium term likely has no impact on on _existing_ landlords' ability or willingness to create new supply given that they are equity constrained. A higher rate of return may accelerate the rate at which they are able to accumulate more equity, but over the short term does not automatically improve their ability to add supply.[hulchanski letter]

Therefore, increases in rent due to increased local demand is in effect a transfer from tenants to landlords - tenants' incomes are reduced for no increase in welfare, and we reduce our productivity overal by rewarding unproductive investments, and removing income that vould be used in entrepreneurial activities or even just more useful consumption.

Glouser mentions this is inefficient, but I find the question bizarre if its not also aimed at homeownership markets where there are enormous distortions over time. For instance, Toronto's density has been declining as owners avoid downsizing,[cheryll] a trend that was predictable a whole ten years ago[maclennan-2007].


<h3>Stable rent is an essential technology</h3>

Affordable rentals are required for absorbing new immigrants, which in turn are essential for canada's globalized competitiveness. we need flexibility, and people need to be able to save in order to transition to homeownership in the first place.

<h3>Affordability is only loosely linked to supply</h3>

Ultimately, our housing crisis is a matter of income: tenants with low incomes have an _income_ problem, not a housing problem.[^hswg-final] [^brescia-2005-3] Land prices and other costs, driven by restrictive land use policies and the speculative boom, have grown faster than tenant incomes and pushed financial recovery rents beyond what most of the rental population can afford or finds reasonable.

In the absence of subsidy, the private sector is unlikely to build new rental housing for the low end of the market. Though the profitability of building modest cost ownership housing in large volumes can approach that of smaller quantities of high end ownership housing, the same is not true for affordable rentals. It costs only slightly less to build an affordable rental, compared to building high end, but the resulting income stream is substantially smaller.[^hswg-2001]

Relatively affordable privately developed housing, then, occurs because as inflation and mortgage payments decrease operating costs over time the rent necessary to carry a rental investment decreases. And, through a process called filtering, new high-end housing creates vacancies lower in the chain as people move on up to occupy new supply. In theory, as the existing housing stock ages and deteriorates, people with higher incomes will tend to prefer newer, higher quality housing.[^brescia-2005-2]


Canada housing markets undergo regular boom and bust cycles - early 1920s, 1970s, today - where demographic spikes foment rapidly inflation driven by largely exogenous reasons like stagflation and today's tight integration with global capital markets.

By definition, low vacancies occur because there are more people searching for housing than there are available units. It takes several years to build a new house or apartment, which is why the supply of new housing is considered "inelastic" over the short term.

<h3>Status quo requires intervention</h3>

canada today has one of the highest rates of homeownership in the world, but that was not always so; at the turn of the century vast majority of people rented [some Dennis paper] that ownership rates changed was no accident as the canadian government began large scale interventions in housing markets in the 1940s, and then in the 1970s shifted explicitly towards supporting homeownership.

Hulchanksi, writing in whevener, characterizes it as neglect

<h3>Making the economic case for rent controls</h3>


Over the past decade we've been undergoing yet another speculative boom that is quickly inflating land values at a rate far beyond that of wage increases. Prices per acre in the GTA have tripled, and meanwhile rents have gone up by 11% per year. By 2017 it is increasingly hard to avoid the observation that these spikes are being driven by global macro financial conditions and are unattached to "market fundamentals". Toronto has grown at a steady 1% per year yet somehow our land has doubled in desireability. If this trend is allowed to continue unabated then homeownership - a linchpin of Canadian housing policy over the past fifty years - will undoubtedly be out of reach for most Canadians. 

One way or another, a serious adjustment is in order. The unabated inflation of land vlaues is untenable, to my mind, but considering the distribution of capital gains it's unlikely that any future government will win on a mandate of land deflation and mass impoverishment. Given that, it is not enough for well-housed columnists to issue smug proclamations; mass homeownership was a deliberate policy, and if we are forced to revert to the mean and approach mass renting then we will be better served to be deliberate about it rather than stumbling towards it, fumbling in the dark.

While some public officials have strived to prepare Canadians for a "vertical living" in our downtowns, it's readily apparent that the current construction designed entirely for investor market is woefully inadequate - avg sizes of units have been decreasing, three bedrooms cost as much as houses, etc.

the market is failing us in a number of ways.

a well designed rent stabilization program does not endanger the business model of 


Lately, rents have been increasing by about 11% per year, to an average range of $2.67-2.89 per square foot in 2017. Land values per acre in the Greater Toronto Area have tripled over the last ten years, and consequently new rental building development must target rents in the $3 per square foot range. [^tal-cibc-2]



If the economics undergirding multi-residential property investments don't rely on regular above-cost-inflation rent increases, then we should be discussing instead how to properly design a control that does not impede the well-functioning of that business.

<h3>A Brief History of Housing in Canada</h3>

Property rights and the markets they enable exist to the extent they are enforced and protected by the state. When we establish and regulate rights, we typically seek to balance the interests and concerns of everyone involved, and revisit those tradeoffs as our values and goals shift over time. We think our food should be safe to eat, our doctors should be well trained, and that you shouldn't dump waste anywhere you feel like.

In Canada, it would be difficult to identify a time when we had a completely laissez faire housing market. Some of our earliest municipal bylaws regulated building standards. First, we sought to improve our health, safety, fire and construction standards, and later we gradually began to add a host of land use and development regulations.[^hulchanksi-laissez]

These regulations led to the elimination of unhealthy, unsafe and poor quality housing in urban areas. If in 1951 almost one out of every ten houses lacked basic plumbing facilities, by 1982 that had dropped to 1.6%.[^brescia-2005-4] However, our improved housing standards and growing restrictions on land use led to an increase in the cost of its manufacture. As early as 1914 it became apparent that the private market alone was not providing enough low income housing.[^hulchanksi-laissez] 

One intervention begat another. Federal incentives were introduced in 1938 to stimulate the development of low income rental housing, and by 1949 the government began to invest directly in its production.[^hulchanksi-laissez] Buoyed by the post-war economic and population boom,  we began to seriously expand our welfare state and, concerned with ensuring "enough rental housing production to nourish the golden goose of urban growth", from 1965 to 1995 up to 10% of all new housing was some mix of social housing.[^suttor-abriged]

These interventions were not limited to the poor; quite the opposite. In 1946, the CMHC was established with the aim of increasing home ownership among the broad middle and lower-middle class. Focussing mainly on making amortized mortgages work for house buyers and private investors in rental housing, by the mid-1960s most households obtained at least part of their mortgage loan directly from the federal government.[^hulchanski-bulletin38]

In fact, most of the history of the role of Canadian government housing policy is an effort to assist ownership. In 2005 alone, more individual homeowners were helped through mortgage insurance than the number of all social housing units funded since the 1970s. And in addition to creating cheaper loans, the federal government also provides subsidies through a variety of tax credits, tax sheltered investment vehicles and tax exemptions. When the federal government began taxing capital gains it exempted the sale of primary residence &mdash; which by 2008 was costing us almost $6 billion a year in uncollected revenue.[^hulchanski-bulletin38]

In so far that our housing policy has targetted the middle class' standard of living, it has been rather successful. As an investment asset, home ownership confers unique benefits: it provides shelter as well as equity that can be withdrawn later in life. Canadians who pay off their mortgages spend on average only 11% of their income on housing and, by 1999, the average homeowner earned 208% more income, and owned 70 times more wealth, than the average tenant.[^hulchanski-bulletin38]




<h3>Tenants have rights, too</h3>

This is to say: what kind of living conditions do we want people to enjoy? and consequently, what, exactly, should be the goal of our housing system? have been considered important questions for over a century &mdash; and our answers to these questions have shifted over time. We began by regulating the safety of our housing, and today we significantly subsidize its ownership for those who can afford it. 

Similarly, our perception of the nature of the relationship between property owners and tenants has also shifted.[^yorke-2015]

Under common law, which concerned itself with a leaseholder's (agricultural) relationship to the land, a landlord was under no statutory requirement to maintain the premises or conduct any repairs &mdash; nor were there any limits on their power to evict or even seize the property of tenants. A review of the applicable laws in 1968 found that landlords possessed such a disparity of bargaining power that tenants did not have a freedom of contract in any real sense.[^hulchanksi-tenant-rights]

For a variety of ethical, legal and economic reasons, it became clear that tenants deserved protection, and that applying old-school land law principles to the modern urban apartment rental was totally unsuitable. Gradually the law caught up: Ontario adopted its first residential protection laws in 1970, while the notion that tenants deserve security of tenure was added by 1975. Today, landlords are seen as responsible for providing safe and livable accomodations, and that tenants should be protected from arbitrary evictions.[^yee-1989]

Often, this is framed as a conflict of self-interests between landlords and tenants; tenants suffer disproportionate costs when forced to move, and benefit from stability. But security of tenure doesn't just benefit individual tenants. The stability provided by security of tenure is the stuff from which well functioning communities are made of.

<h3>Security of tenure is a public good</h3>

In economics there exists a concept of a "public good", which broadly applies to any "service" or "thing that people derive benefit from" that is both non-excludable and non-rivalrous. Non-excludable means that you can't prevent people from enjoying it; non-rivalrous means that by enjoying the good you are not depriving other people from doing the same.[^cowen-2007]

The classical examples include clean air, national security, knowledge, and so on. I can't prevent you from breathing in the same fresh air that I'm enjoying, and when you consume official government statistics you are not depriving me of the same benefit. Public goods aren't necessarily provided by the state, much the same way that the state provides access to some private goods. The distinction is relevant because the nature of public goods incentivizes people to be jerks and therefore public goods "must be provided for everyone if they are to be provided for anyone, and they must be paid for collectively or they cannot be had at all"[^galea-2016]

Though housing itself is a private good, one's enjoyment of security does not impinge on the security of others. As we've seen, security of tenure cannot be provided without a collective investment of some sort since individual tenants rarely possess the bargaining power to afford it themselves. But more importantly, security of tenure provides benefits to the community at large &mdash; and in that vein also suffers from the free-rider problem that plagues other public goods.

<h3>Security of tenure is good for the public</h3>

Our communities consist of both physical infrastructure, like roads and public transit, as well as "human" infrastructure, like community organizations and loose neighbourhood ties. A neighbourhood may be desirable for its proximity to a grocery store &mdash; but also for the quality of its schools, the absence of crime and the vitality of its community events. A healthy neighbourhood is one where its residents are looking out for one another.

In this tenants face substantial hurdles. I recently read Matthew Desmond's incredible and harrowing book "Eviction," in which he followed several low-income renters in the city of Milwaukee over the course of a year. Early on, he writes:

> "The public peace&mdash;the sidewalk and street peace&mdash;of cities is not kept primarily by the police, necessary as police are. It is kept primarily by an intricate, almost unconscious, network of voluntary controls and standards among the people themselves, and enforced by the people themselves." So wrote Jane Jacobs in _The Death and Life of Great American Cities_. Jacobs believed that a prerequisite for this type of healthy and engaged community was the presence of people who were simply present, who looked after the neighborhood.  She has been proved right: disadvantaged neighborhoods with higher levels of "collective efficacy"&mdash;the stuff of loosely linked neighbors who trust one another and share expectations about how to make their community better&mdash;have lower crime rates.

Towards the end of the book, he adds:

> Residential stability begets a kind of psychological stability, which allows people to invest in their home and social relationships. It begets school stability, which increases the chances that children will excel and graduate. And it begets community stability, which encourages neighbours to form strong bonds and take care of their block. But poor families enjoy little of that because they are evicted at such high rates. 

> [...]

> Eviction even affects the communities that displaced families leave behind. Neighbors who cooperate with and trust one another can make their streets safer and more prosperous. But that takes time. Efforts to establish local cohesion and community investment are thwarted in neighborhoods with high turnover rates. In this way, eviction can unravel the fabric of a community, helping to ensure that neighbors remain strangers and that their collective capacity to combat crime and promote civic engagement remains untapped.[^desmond]

Faced with the unpredictable but certain need to move in the near future, it's harder to establish deep ties to an neighbourhood. As a result, tenants are routinely discounted or ignored by our political structures,[^mcgrath-2017] and face greater hardships accessing necessary social services and economic opportunities.

In addition, landlords are also strongly incentivized to cash in on new or improved local amenities provided either by the state or the local community itself. The reduction of crime, or the expansion of public transit, readily provide rationales for increasing rents. Creating conditions where tenants may reasonably fear the amelioration of their communities is a rather perverse outcome.

For these reasons, it's necessary to distinguish protecting the moral rights of existing, long term tenants from the problem of affordabiliy and supply.[^psmag] If the market is unable to sustain tenants' security of tenure, then we should find other ways to provide it.

Every regulation imposes tradeoffs, and in that light the regulation of rent should be seen as not unlike that of the regulation of fire safety. Mandating that landlords' properties satisfy certain minimum fire safety standards also raises costs and therefore diminishes the affordability of housing. Though some are happy to make that macabre argument,[^mcardle-2017] by and large we've decided it's a cost worth bearing: individual people are rarely in position to demand improved construction standards, and fires have large externalities. At some point, we will always be dealing with thresholds and equilibriums, and it is up to society to decide what is or isn't acceptable: in Ontario, only about 7 people per million die every year in residential fires.[^fire-deaths]


In 2011, a little under half of the population of the city of Toronto rented their housing,[^census-2011] and in 2017 home-ownership is out of reach for the young and those with middle and low incomes.[^cbc-squeeze] Long term tenants have a legitimate interest in staying in the communities they themselves have made successful. Why should they be subjected to a tenure regime that significantly disadvantages them socially, economically and politically compared to the subsidized homeowning population?

We do ourselves a disservice when we ignore this dimension and frame it purely in terms of adversarial self interests. When we argue that rents should always be uncontrolled, even in tight markets experiencing rapid inflation, we're implicitly accepting that tenants do not deserve security of tenure. The discussion instead should be about how we can both deliver security of tenure and ensure our housing provision system functions properly.

<!--

<h2>Revisiting Ontario's experience</h2>

Let's address the main criticism: what about the lack of supply in our housing market?  While the social benefits are hard to value precisely, the cost of a tight housing market is all too readily apparent &mdash; and might outweigh the benefit.




When we talk about preventing the regulation of rents, bracketing poorly designed controls, the concern becomes about keeping median rent levels on par with rising land prices. Rents in a newly constructed building must cover their costs; land values per acre in the Greater Toronto Area have tripled over the last decade. In 2016 rents in Toronto increased by 11% to reach a record average of $2.77 per square foot but new rental projects must charge over $3 psf.[^tal-cibc-2]

Arguably, "artificially" depressing median rents therefore also acts as a supply disincentive. This tends to be implicitl


eeeeh this isn't very good.



So far we've examined the social need for security of tenure, why it requires rent controls, the reasons why tenant protection laws should be considered in their own right, the many ways in which we actively guide and interfere with the housing market, the business models undergirding residential construction, and the evidence suggesting that tackling our undersupply of housing requires policies beyond rent deregulation.

Given that the rent necessary to recoup an investment is largely determined by debt servicing and other operating costs, new projects therefore must target the top end of the market.


However, as discussed above, the government provides substantial incentives towards homeownership. The people most inclined to pay high end rents are siphoned off from rentals onto the ownership market; if you can afford the mortgage, it usually makes financial sense to buy. And, because the majority of housing stock has already been built and is therefore cheaper, average rents are often quite lower than the rent necessary to recoup new investment.



But why stop at just a tenancy control?

Take Toronto. Compiling data from the CMHC and a City of Toronto report, I produced a graph that illustrates the ways in which our housing mix is shifting:

Obviously, a control regime that over time lowers real income below that of real expenditures is a _bad idea_. It's fine, and probably necessary, to subsidize some aspects of renting in order to achieve our housing policy goals, but it's not really rational to expect that to come exclusively at the economic detriment of landlords.

However

In fact, it seems that historically the private market's willingness to build large quantities of rental buildings is a function of the extent they're effective short and medium term _tax shelters_.

<h3>Making the economic case for rent controls</h3>


I'd like to go one step further, and ask: who benefits from unregulated rents &mdash; and why should they?

Starting in the late 1960s, we made a series of policy choices. Condominiums in Ontario were legalized in 1967, and we modified our income and sales tax systems in ways that strongly discourage private capital from flowing into private rental apartments. Meanwhile, by the mid 1990s we almost completely stopped investing in public housing strategies.

Our population has kept growing, though. Compiling data from the CMHC and a City of Toronto report, I produced a graph that illustrates the ways in which our housing mix is shifting:

A little under half of Toronto's residents rent and this percentage has remained stable since 1971. Since primary rentals have remained stagnant, this means that the growth in tenant population has been absorded by the secondary rental market.[^toronto-2006] To the best of our knowledge, the secondary rental market houses a bit under half of Toronto's tenants.[^cmhc-2016] 

By 2016, it was estimated that 34% of all condos were destined to be rented out.[^gadon-2017] Who buys condos and why?

In 1990, 24% of Toronto tenants reported being in core housing need and by 2011 we measured 32%.

[^arnott-monopoly]: Arnott makes the case that housing markets are actually monopolistically competitive since housing structures and preferences are not homogenous, there are substantial asymmetries in information, and transactions costs are non-trivial. Consequently, rents are set higher than their efficient level and the corresponding deadweight loss can be mitigated (Arnott 2003, p. 106). But for our purposes we don't need to engage with this argument.

[^macfarlane-2001]: Writing in 2001, Alastair McFarlane developed an econometric model of rent stabilization and concluded that "because allowing fully flexible base rents permits landlords to capture all of the advantages of a rent growth control, neither the timing nor the density of development will be affected by rent stabilization", though landlords are incentivized to redevelop sooner than later. <br/><br/>Mcfarlane, A.

[^quibbling]: Relaxing intensification targets and eating away at the Greenbelt seems short sighted. It says a lot that in terms of our political economy giving up those goals is easier than rezoning our land and increasing density. However, it will harm us in the long run as we miss out on economic clustering effects and continue to waste good money on unsustainable low density development. While I'm at it, the implicit assumption that the present equilibrium, where land prices are allowed to inflate at arbitrary values, is value neutral or not worth direct policy action is suspect but then again, I don't work at a mortgage lender ;).

[^yorke-2015]: I haven't been able to corroborate this quote but it's eye popping:<br/><br/>"The next year, 1969, the Vancouver Tenants Council <strong>campaigned actively for the right of tenants to vote in civic elections,</strong> for enforcement of the building code, for changes in the Landlord and Tenant Act, for abolition of the Distress Act, and that landlords be compelled to give reasons for evictions." <br><br>I knew that in both Vancouver and Toronto non-resident property owners get to vote (presumably since they pay property taxes) but it blew my mind that this wasn't originally extended to _tenants_!<br/><br/> Yorke, B.
