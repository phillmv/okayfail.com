<h2>A familiar face</h2>
I started noticing the azulejos the day I rented my first solo apartment.

<!-- <p>Comecei a reparar nos azulejos no dia em que aluguei o meu primeiro T1.
Apresentei-me ao endereco indicado, e lá estava ela: Nossa Senhora de Fátima, a abencoar os tres pastorinhos, pintada a mao, montada pela porta. Sorri-me.

Eu cresci numa aldeia perto de Fátima, ai uns quinze minutos de distancia. Com os meus avos, muito catolicos, atendi a missa no santuario num dia treze, a apanhar sol. Durante o ensino basico, atendi-la a escola, completo com freiras. Subi as escadas, obviamente, o senhorio era portugues. Fiquei com o apartamento.</p> -->

I arrived at the address and there she was: Nossa Senhora de Fátima, blessing the three little shepherds, hand painted across six ceramic tiles and mounted by the front door. I smiled. 

I grew up near Fátima. In grade five, I went to school there. I climbed up the stairs to meet the landlord who, as I expected, was an old Portuguese man. I got the apartment.[^oldpeople]

From then on, I began to notice the azulejos more carefully.

They're common throughout Toronto's West End, where they are almost always religiously themed, and they decorate the porches and entrances of many houses. Azulejos come in many sizes and colours, but they're usually 15cm wide and quite often blue. And, though they depict generic-looking Catholic iconography, to find a set is to know the owner of the residence is Portuguese. 

You can be certain of this knowledge for two reasons.

One, most of the saints they depict are, well, Portuguese. Take Fátima,[^fatima] for instance.

In 1917, Nossa Senhora (Our Lady) the Virgin Mary appeared[^appeared] to, and hung out with, three little shepherds[^childlabour] in the village of Fátima. She did this six times over the course of several months and, before she left for good, she gave the shepherds three secrets and performed some miracles. People were so impressed, they built an immense Sanctuary right on the spot. Today, it receives millions of tourists every year.

While Fátima is the most famous... visit by Our Lady, the Lord works in mysterious ways. Over the centuries every other town has had a holy appearance or become associated with a patron saint.

The other reason is that the azulejo itself is a distinctly Portuguese art form, though they are also common in Spain and popular in Latin America. 

They were introduced by the Moorish invaders, who brought with them their Arabesque decorative ceramics and an obsession with filling empty space. Adopted first in Spain and in the 1500s imported to Portugal, by the 1700s they became widely used. Many houses in Portugal today are covered top to bottom, inside and out, in azulejos: they're cheap, they last forever, they're easy to clean, and they keep things cool in the summer.

To glance at an azulejo is to have a suspicion, and to see the tortured face of Senhor Santo Cristo dos Milagres (Lord Holy Christ of Miracles) is to know the owners are probably from the Açores.[^archipelago]

<h2>Preemptive nostalgia </h2>

In May of 2015, we applied and were accepted to Y Combinator, a prestigious startup accelerator. In exchange for money and mentorship, we were expected to spend the following three months in California.

This was great news, but my immediate reaction was to feel dread and a light sadness: we were gonna miss out on summer in Toronto.

Summertime Toronto is paradise, made all the greater by its contrast with winter. After all those wet, cold, dark and interminable months, people emerge from hiding, shed their layers and Toronto sprouts and blossoms into being. To truly live in Toronto, as I understand it, is to ferry to the islands and chill on the beach; to idly drink on patios; to stalk the hot and humid sweet summer nights.

That winter had been an unusually harsh one.

Besides, we might end up staying for quite some time. To work on a startup is to believe in its epic greatness; to succeed, many people believe, is to relocate fairly permanently. As the epicentre of our industry, the San Fracisco Bay Area exerts a certain gravity on all software engineers.

As we packed and sorted and got ready to leave, sadness gave way to mourning and I found myself wistfully pacing through our neighborhood.

I've lived in Little Portugal since 2011 and for most of it I had it both ways. I got to live in my ethnic enclave, which coincidentally was also the hippest neighborhood in town. I soaked my hangovers with fatty leitão à Bairrada, and on a whim treated myself to a pastel de nata. I often did all my shopping without speaking a word of English. And, in exchange for travel agencies and knick-knack stores, I was provided with an endless variety of cool new bars and restaurants. Friends and first dates would spontaneously pick a spot just across the street from my apartment. Life was good.

Yet, it did catch up to me; I'd just been evicted, and though I scored an amazing housing deal, staying in the neighbourhood was becoming a struggle. Historic, runaway price inflation was causing the few remaining working class Portuguese people to cash out, and in their stead were wealthy Anglos. People have a tendency to flatten or renovate their new properties, and so I had a strong feeling these little symbols were about to be gentrified away.

I got to live in my ethnic enclave, and reward myself with a pastel de nata, or soak my hangovers with rotisserie chicken  - but I also rather enjoyed living  the rapid gentrification and the non-stop proliferation of cool bars and restaurants.

YouImmediately after receiving the notifyin phonecall, I was filled with dread; Toronto in the summer is paradise, and we'd just come out of a harsh winter. To truly live in Toronto is to ferry to the islands and chill on the beach; to pop a beer and lie on the grass in Trinity Bellwoods; to stalk the hot and humid sweet summer nights. These days I try to get my mourning right out and front - for Max, the immensity of our loss had only registered the week after we'd arrived in Mountain View - and so while we packed for California I exercised my nostalgia preemptively by compulsively cataloguing all the azulejos in the specific corner of Little Portugal we inhabited.

With historic, runaway price inflation, many of the few remaining working class Portuguese people that used to comprise most of the neighborhood are cashing out. People have a tendency to flatten or renovate their new properties, and so I had a strong sense that these little symbols were being gentrified away.



They're not uncommon throughout the west end of Toronto, decorating the porches of many houses. To come across a set is to know that the owners are Portuguese &mdash; but since their iconography is generically catholic, I think a lot of people don't realize it. 

There are two reasons why you can know this with certainty.


First, they often depict uniquely Portuguese icons. In 1917, over several months, the Virgin Mary appeared and hung out with three young shepherds in the small town of Fátima. She gave them three secrets, and performed a miracle or two, and people were so impressed they built a huge cathedral right on the spot. Today, it's a small city, and it receives _millions_ of tourists every year[^fatima].


Second, the azulejo itself &mdash; a ceramic tile, often coloured blue, and usually painted with repeating geometric figures &mdash; is a uniquely Portuguese art form[^wellspanish]. Houses in Portugal today are often totally covered, inside and out, in azulejos. They're cheap, they last forever, they're easy to clean, and they keep things cool in the summer[^wordazulejo].






[^appeared]: Think less "showed up" and more "apparation".

[^childlabour]: Think less "picturesque" and more "child labour". The oldest was ten, and this being deep rural Portugal, they very likely received little if any education.



[^oldpeople]: I smiled and chatted with him in Portuguese, to the annoyance of the other people at the showing. A year and a half later, when I left, his wife told me I was like another grandson. That's not the interesting part.

[^fatima]: Its name comes from the Arabic _[فَاطِمَة ‎‎](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatima_(given_name))_ which, according to legend, was the name of a Moorish princess captured during the christian Reconquista in 1158. I've attended mass both in the cathedral, and outside, during high season, when tens of thousands of pilgrims congregate in the sanctuary grounds.

[^archipelago]: Which to be fair, is not a hard guess. Portugal is for the most part a stone raft stuck to the west end of Europe, but most Portuguese immigrants in North America came from the Açores: if you thought the "continent" was an impoverished, isolated place, well, try being out in _the middle of the ocean_.


[^wordazulejo]: The Portuguese word _azulejo_ can also be traced back to an Arabic word, _[الزليج‎‎](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zellige)_. It was introduced in Portugal in the 1500s and really took off in the 1700s. I recently went to the [National Tile Museum](http://www.museudoazulejo.pt/en-GB/default.aspx), in Lisbon, situated in an old monastery. It's worth a visit!
