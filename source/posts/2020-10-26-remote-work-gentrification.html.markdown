title: "Remote Work Isn't Gentrification"
draft: true

A reader asks,

> In San Francisco it is easy to see flush tech workers buy up houses in cash, drive up markets, and displace people from their historic neighbourhoods.

> As more and more companies take up remote work, more and more people will be earning tech worker wages while living in regions with lower median incomes.

> I feel like these workers will inevitably compete with lower-paid locals for housing, and accelerate their displacement.

> Doesn't this mean that more well-paid remote work can be harmful?

Hello! Thank you for asking this question. Let's unpack this a little.

In 2017, on a lark, I spent three months researching and writing a [~40 page paper on the nature of rent control](/2018/rent-control-great-security-of-tenure.html). This doesn’t make me an expert, but I think it does mean I’ve spent more time reading about land use and real estate development patterns and economics than the average bear.

In the micro-sense, this example is indeed what gentrification looks like. High-income people outcompete low-income people for the same housing units, and thereby displace them to other neighbourhoods, or out of their cities altogether.

But in the macro-sense, the causal mechanism underpinning gentrification is driven by three broad trends:

1. Higher productivity returns to “superstar” regions due to [agglomeration effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economies_of_agglomeration).

2. Inadequate regional [land-use policies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land-use_planning) and investment patterns for absorbing population growth.

3. Growing global wealth inequality fueling [housing financialization](https://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Housing/Pages/FinancializationHousing.aspx).

For example, the first trend is why so many people want to live in nice big cities, since there is so much more opportunity.

The second trend is zoning bylaws restricting density, thereby forcing high-income people to compete with low-income people. But it's simultaneously also a huge underinvestment in public transportation and other public goods, i.e. everyone wants to live near a BART or Caltrain station, or near nice schools, etc, but we don’t build more of them.

Finally, the third trend is that, [in the Piketty sense](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/12/business/economy/a-relentless-rise-in-unequal-wealth.html), Capital’s share of Income is growing faster than Labour’s share of Income, which leads to flush credit markets encouraging over-leveraged investments and private equity firms flush with cash chasing returns, etc.

While individual high-income households sometimes compete directly with low-income households, it’s [private equity firms that are buying houses by the thousands](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/02/single-family-landlords-wall-street/582394/) and [entire apartment buildings by the handful](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07352166.2019.1705846) with the express purpose of renovating them and squeezing out low-income tenants.

To bring this back to tech companies and tech workers, one’s personal impact on one’s housing market really will vary according to where you live.

If you live in an economically depressed area – i.e. Pittsburgh, Detroit, Baltimore, Cleveland, and so on, all cities that today have far fewer residents than they used to, and lots of vacant housing to show for it – it's a net positive for you to earn more and spend more in your local economy as opposed to just competing for the same scarce resources in the SF Bay Area.

Or, you might just live in an area that has OK housing policy and or is able to grow at a rate capable of equitably accommodating the demand they face. In either case, you’re not displacing anyone. Paying people who live in those regions more is a kind of income-redistribution away from the superstar region.

More broadly, however, is the impact that “being paid less” also has. Whenever a worker that is underpaid relative to the value they produce for the organization, that surplus value doesn’t disappear: it’s ultimately captured instead by their shareholders.

For many companies, and this is true for every company in the S&P500, their largest shareholders are institutional investors, i.e. private equity firms like BlackRock.

So in a very real if indirect sense, it is the act of underpaying workers relative to the value they produce that ends up giving firms like BlackRock the excess cash to then go and gentrify their neighbourhoods.

Food for thought!
